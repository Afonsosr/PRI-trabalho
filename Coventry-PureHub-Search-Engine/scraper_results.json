        "abstract": "In today’s modern world, societies are utterly attached to internet and technologies to access more information, switching the traditional modes of communication to virtual – all at large scale simultaneously. Governments are using advanced innovative technologies to provide end-to-end integrated public services e.g. in the form of electronic government (e-Government); nevertheless, how effective and efficient their communication with public society are and where citizens engagement has been considered to deliver the services – these still remain unexplored. This developing paper is considering Industry 4.0 (I4.0), Society 5.0 (S5.0), sustainability and circular economy in order to review the impact of I4.0 on manufacturing, what various governments planned to adopt I4.0 technologies within public services and direct communication with citizens. Eventually introducing some of the opportunities, challenges and gaps within citizen’s electronic engagement (e-Engagement) which is a term of digital communication between citizens and public decision makers."

We aimed to compare Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, adjustable gastric banding, and sleeve gastrectomy in patients with severe obesity.Methods: By-Band-Sleeve is a pragmatic, multi-centre, open-label, randomised controlled trial conducted in 12 hospitals in the UK. Eligible participants were adults (aged ≥18 years) meeting national criteria for metabolic and bariatric surgery. Initially, a 2-group trial (Roux-en-Y gastric bypass versus adjustable gastric banding) became a 3-group trial to include sleeve gastrectomy at 2·6 years from study opening, when it became widely used in the UK. Co-primary endpoints were weight (proportion achieving ≥50% excess weight loss) and quality-of-life (EQ-5D utility score) at 3 years. If the proportion achieving at least 50% excess weight loss was non-inferior (<12% difference between groups) and quality-of-life was superior, sleeve gastrectomy and Roux-en-Y gastric bypass were considered more effective than adjustable gastric banding, and sleeve gastrectomy more effective than Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. Cost-effectiveness of the procedures was compared. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02841527, and ISRCTN, 00786323."

Reported variation in commissioning and bariatric surgery eligibility criteria has not been previously mapped. Freedom of Information (FOI) requests provide a tool, supported by legislation, to ask questions of public authorities including ICSs such that they must respond accurately. FOIs were sent to all 42 ICSs in England asking 4 questions aiming to establish whether there is variation in the commissioning of specialist weight management services and the eligibility criteria for bariatric surgery across England. Responses were presented descriptively and mapped across England. Responses were received from 41 out of 42 ICSs, with 34 reporting that they provide commissioned medical weight management programmes and 38 funding bariatric surgery. Thirteen reported using criteria that were not compliant with NICE guidance. A large area of the country centred around the East of England does not have a bariatric unit reducing access to care. There is significant geographical variation in the availability of both bariatric and specialist medical weight management services across England, with large portions of the country without local access to a service or no service at all. Where services are available, there is significant inconsistency in eligibility for bariatric surgery despite nationally available guidance."

        "abstract": "To use vignettes to facilitate exploration of the internal dialogue and clinical reasoning processes of general practice healthcare professionals (GPHCPs) during interactions with patients living with obesity. This study used an exploratory qualitative research design. Data were collected using semistructured interviews. Interviews were transcribed verbatim, and data analysed using Framework Method analysis. Five vignettes were presented to participants, showing a patient's photograph, name, age and body mass index. Participants were asked to describe their first impressions of each fictionalised patient. Interviews were conducted remotely via Skype between August and September 2019. A convenience sample of UK GPHCPs was recruited via a targeted social media strategy, using virtual snowball sampling. 20 participants were interviewed (11 general practice nurses and 9 general practitioners). Five themes were generated: visual assessment, assumed internal contributing factors, assumed external contributing factors, potential clinical contributing factors and potential clinical consequences. A pattern-recognition approach was identified, as GPHCPs' assumptions around patients' lifestyles, occupations and eating habits emerged as explanations for their weight, with a mixture of both objective and subjective comments. While it is part of the diagnostic skill of a clinician to be able to form a clinical picture based on the information available, it is important to be aware of the potential for assumptions made within this process to contribute to unconscious bias\/stereotyping. Healthcare professionals need to work to counteract the potential impact of internal bias on their consultations to provide fair and equitable care for people living with obesity, by exercising reflexivity within their clinical practice.

The meetings were attended by 28 and 27 participants, respectively, including a geographically diverse selection of people living with obesity (PLWO) and experts from various disciplines.Out of 24 PROs and 16 PROMs identified in the first S.Q.O.T. consensus meeting, the following nine PROs and three PROMs were selected via consensus: BODY‐Q (physical function, physical symptoms, psychological function, social function, eating behavior, and body image), IWQOL‐Lite (self‐esteem), and QOLOS (excess skin). No PROM was selected to measure stigma as existing PROMs deemed to be inadequate. A core set of PROMs to measure QoL in research focused on obesity treatment has been selected incorporating patients' and experts' opinions.

The objective of this study was to select a core set of patient-reported outcomes and patient-reported outcome measures to be used in clinical obesity care. Materials and Methods: The Standardizing Quality of Life in Obesity Treatment III, face-to-face hybrid consensus meeting, including people living with obesity as well as healthcare providers, was held in Maastricht, the Netherlands, in 2022. It was preceded by two prior multinational consensus meetings and a systematic review. Results: The meeting was attended by 27 participants, representing twelve countries from five continents. The participants included healthcare providers, such as surgeons, endocrinologists, dietitians, psychologists, researchers, and people living with obesity, most of whom were involved in patient representative networks. Three patient-reported outcome measures (patient-reported outcomes) were selected: the Impact of Weight on Quality of Life-Lite (self-esteem) measure, the BODY-Q (physical function, physical symptoms, psychological function, social function, eating behavior, and body image), and the Quality of Life for Obesity Surgery questionnaire (excess skin). No patient-reported outcome measure was selected for stigma. Conclusion: A core set of patient-reported outcomes and patient-reported outcome measures for measuring quality of life in clinical obesity care is established incorporating patients’ and experts’ opinions. This set should be used as a minimum for measuring quality of life in routine clinical practice. It is essential that individual patient-reported outcome measure scores are shared with people living with obesity in order to enhance patient engagement and shared decision-making.

However, the prevalence and impact of a healthy weight body mass index (BMI) at disease presentation is not known. This study aimed to evaluate the visual and headache outcomes stratified by the presenting BMI. This was a longitudinal prospective cohort study (IIH Life) based on a tertiary neuro-ophthalmology IIH service, University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Trust, United Kingdom, recruiting consecutive patients living with IIH between 2012 and 2021. Those with a presenting BMI were included. The outcome measures included visual outcomes of LogMAR visual acuity, Humphrey visual field perimetric mean deviation (PMD), optical coherence tomography (OCT) measurements, and headache outcomes of frequency, severity, and Headache Impact Test-6 score. Three hundred seventy-five people with IIH and a documented baseline BMI. About 3.7% of the entire cohort had a healthy weight BMI at IIH presentation and 15.5% BMI < 30 kg\/m2. The baseline PMD was worse in patients without obesity; however, OCT papilloedema measures were similar. The presence of obesity was associated with a small but significant greater worsening in visual acuity but slower macular ganglion cell layer loss. There was no impact on PMD or papilloedema prognosis related to baseline obesity. The headache outcomes showed heterogeneity, with worse baseline headache frequency in patients with obesity. No BMI group was associated with worse headache outcomes. Patients with a healthy weight BMI or those without obesity at baseline make up a small proportion of IIH patients. BMI at presentation does not appear to influence long-term visual or headache outcomes."

        "abstract": "Background: The prevalence of obesity is rising globally and effective strategies to treat obesity are needed. Intermittent fasting, a dietary intervention for weight management, has received growing interest from the general public, as well as healthcare professionals, as a form of lifestyle intervention. Methods: We executed a rapid review using PUBMED database to identify systematic reviews that examined the impact of intermittent fasting on metabolic indices, published between 2011 and 2022. Results: Intermittent fasting leads to weight loss of a similar magnitude to continuous energy restriction. Most of the evidence shows that intermittent fasting leads to greater fat loss as measured by fat mass (kg) or body fat percentage compared to an ad libitum diet, but fat loss attained during intermittent fasting is not significantly different to continuous energy restriction, although recent evidence shows intermittent fasting to be superior. There is mixed evidence for the impact of intermittent fasting on insulin resistance, fasting glucose and lipid profile. Some studies focused on populations of Muslim people, which showed that Ramadan fasting may lead to weight loss and improvement of metabolic parameters during fasting, although the effects are reversed when fasting is finished. Conclusions: Intermittent fasting is more effective than an ad libitum dietary intake, and equally or more effective as continuous energy restriction, for weight management. However, there is inconclusive evidence on whether intermittent fasting has a clinically beneficial effect on glucose and lipid metabolism."

PBH develops relatively late after surgery and often after discharge from post-surgical follow-up by bariatric teams, leading to variability in diagnosis and management in non-specialist centres.AimThe overall aim was to improve and standardise clinical practice in the diagnosis and management of PBH. The objectives were: (1) to undertake an up-to-date review of the current literature; (2) to formulate practical and evidence-based guidance regarding the diagnosis and treatment of PBH; (3) to recommend future avenues for research in this condition.MethodA scoping review was undertaken after an extensive literature search. A consensus on the guidance and confidence in the recommendations was reached by the steering group authors prior to review by key stakeholders.OutcomeWe make pragmatic recommendations for the practical diagnosis and management of PBH, including criteria for diagnosis and recognition, as well as recommendations for research areas that should be explored.Plain English summaryPost-bariatric hypoglycaemia (PBH) is a condition that commonly affects people who have undergone weight loss surgery. In this condition, people develop low blood sugar occurring about 2–4 h after meals, leading to debilitating symptoms such as hunger, sweating, anxiety, palpitations and even blackouts and fainting. PBH is becoming more common as weight loss surgery is being taken up by more people to help with their weight and to help with diabetes. The condition often develops after the patient has been discharged from follow-up after their surgery, which can lead to inconsistent diagnosis and treatment in non-specialist healthcare centres. The lack of clear information and evidence in the existing scientific literature further contributes to the variation in care. To address this problem, the Society for Endocrinology has created new guidelines to help healthcare professionals accurately diagnose and manage this condition. The guidelines were developed with input from dietitians, surgeons and doctors specialising in weight loss, and hormone specialists."

Design\/methodology\/approach: A systematic search of the databases CINAHL, MEDLINE, Scopus and APA PsycINFO was conducted to identify relevant journal articles published up to August 2023. The quality of the included studies was appraised using the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme Qualitative Tool. Data was synthesized and analysed using thematic synthesis. Findings: Four studies from the UK, USA and Canada were included in the meta-synthesis. Three main themes were found: gratifying others, negative childhood experiences and shame and stigma. Practical implications: South Asian women report many socio-cultural factors that can influence eating disorder development. Findings of this meta-synthesis highlight the importance of cultural awareness, and health-care professionals should be aware of the nuanced socio-cultural factors that can influence a South Asian woman’s relationship with food and body image. Originality\/value: South Asian communities are understudied in the context of mental health, including eating disorders. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the first study to synthesize the available qualitative evidence on socio-cultural influences on eating disorder development among South Asian women. These findings have revealed insights that can be harnessed by health-care professionals to better understand factors that contribute to eating disorder development and support cultural awareness."

However, HCPs have concerns about addressing this issue. There is a need to understand the factors that influence HCPs in initiating these conversations to inform strategies to support them. AIM: To explore with HCPs, working in primary care and community settings, their experiences of having conversations about child weight with parents, and the factors that create barriers or facilitate them to have these conversations. DESIGN AND SETTING: A qualitative study with GPs, primary care nurses (PNs), and school nurses (SNs) in England. METHOD: GPs and PNs were recruited to participate in semi-structured interviews. SNs from a community healthcare NHS trust were recruited to participate in focus groups. Vignettes were used to stimulate discussion. Data were analysed guided by the Framework approach. RESULTS: Thirteen GPs, seven PNs, and 20 SNs participated. The following three themes were identified regarding barriers to HCPs having conversations about child excess weight: structural and organisational; HCP related; and parent or family related. The themes identified for the factors that facilitate these conversations were: structural changes (for example, dedicated appointments, access to weight assessment data, joined-up working across agencies); HCP approaches (for example, providing appropriate dietary and physical activity advice); and HCP knowledge and skills (for example, enhancing HCPs' general and weight management-related skills and knowledge of child weight management services). CONCLUSION: A range of barriers exist to HCPs addressing child excess weight with parents in primary care and community settings. Actions to effect structural changes and support HCPs in developing relevant knowledge and skills are required to overcome these barriers."

This research explored individuals' (in the immediate pre-operative and post-operative population) attitudes, beliefs and experiences towards obesity and their journey to bariatric surgery. Seventeen adult participants (males n = 4; age range: 26–64 years) were recruited and participated in a semi-structured interview. Twelve individuals participated prior to undergoing bariatric surgery. Five individuals participated in the early post-operative period (<3 months post-surgery). People living with obesity displayed high optimism for positive outcomes, with participants hoping that bariatric surgery would be different to previous attempts at weight regulation, with there being a clear shift in the locus of control for weight management from self to healthcare professionals. Whilst this is adaptive, there was the presence of seemingly unrealistic optimism, with many pre-surgery participants not relaying the realistic possibility of post-surgery weight-regain. Despite the optimism individuals feel about bariatric surgery, participants felt that the psychological factors influencing eating behaviours are not being addressed by healthcare. These findings suggest that mindfulness, mindful eating, and self-compassion approaches should be incorporated into clinical practice to support weight regulation and adaption to physiological changes after bariatric surgery."

It is not clear whether EE presents to an equal degree among adults, regardless of their body mass index (BMI) status. The aim of this study was to assess whether there is a difference in degree of EE between adults with healthy weight, overweight and obesity. Methods: MEDLINE and APA PsycINFO databases were searched from inception up to January 2022 for studies that reported EE scores from validated questionnaires. The quality of all included studies was assessed using the AXIS tool. Meta‐analysis used random effects and standardised mean difference (SMD). Heterogeneity was investigated usingI2statistics and sensitivity analyses. Results: A total of 11 studies with 7207 participants were included in the meta‐analysis. Degree of EE was greater in adults with a BMI above the healthy range, compared to adults with a healthy BMI (SMD 0.31, 95% CI 0.17 to0.45;I2= 85%). However, subgroup analysis found that degree of EE was greater only in adults with obesity (SMD 0.61, 95% CI 0.41 to 0.81;I2= 62%),and there was no difference in degree of EE between adults with overweight and those with a healthy BMI. Conclusions: Degree of EE is greater among adults living with obesity, compared to adults with a healthy BMI, indicating a need for behavioural support to support EE among people living with obesity seeking weight management.

Reducing focus on weight is a proposed strategy to provide less threatening healthcare experiences. Given the lack of research on weight bias within obesity services, this study aimed to explore implicit bias among obesity specialist HCPs and explore views on non-weight focused approaches.METHODS: Obesity specialist HCPs were invited to a webinar, \"An exploration of non-weight focused approaches within bariatric services\", held in October 2021. Implicit weight bias was examined using the BiasProof mobile device test, based on the Implicit Association Test. Poll data was analysed descriptively, and qualitative data was analysed using framework analysis.FINDINGS: 82 of the 113 HCPs who attended the webinar consented to contribute data to the study. Over half (51%) had an implicit weight bias against PLwO. Most (90%) agreed\/strongly agreed that obesity services are too weight focused and that patients should not be weighed at every appointment (86%). Perceived benefits of taking a non-weight focused approach included patient-led care, reducing stigma and supporting patient wellbeing, while perceived barriers included loss of objectivity, inducing risk and difficulty demonstrating effectiveness.INTERPRETATION: Our findings indicate that half of obesity specialists HCPs in our sample of 82 providers, who are primarily dieticians and psychologists, have an implicit weight bias against PLwO. HCPs feel that a weight-focused approach within services was a barrier to patient care, but that there is a lack of alternative non-weight focused measures. Further research is needed into substitute outcome measures for clinical practice, also seeking the views of PLwO, and into interventions to address implicit weight bias.FUNDING: Johnson & Johnson funded the BiasProof licence and publication open access charge."

        "abstract": "Endoscopic sleeve gastroplasty (ESG) is a minimally invasive procedure that has been demonstrated in the MERIT randomised, controlled trial to result in substantial and durable additional weight loss in adults with obesity compared with lifestyle modification (LM) alone. We sought to conduct the first cost-effectiveness analysis of ESG versus LM alone in adults with class II obesity (BMI 35.0-39.9 kg\/m ) from a national healthcare system perspective in England based on results from this study. A 6-state Markov model was developed comprising 5 BMI-based health states and an absorbing death state. Baseline characteristics, utilities, and transition probabilities were informed by patient-level data from the subset of patients with class II obesity in MERIT. Adverse events (AEs) were based on the MERIT safety population. Mortality was estimated by applying BMI-specific hazard ratios from the published literature to UK general population mortality rates. Utilities for the healthy weight and overweight health states were informed from the literature; disutility associated with increasing BMI in the class I-III obesity health states was estimated using MERIT utility data. Disutility due to AEs and the prevalence of obesity-related comorbidities were based on the literature. Costs included intervention costs, AE costs, and comorbidity costs. ESG resulted in higher overall costs than LM alone but led to an increase in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for ESG vs LM alone was £2453\/QALY gained. ESG was consistently cost effective across a wide range of sensitivity analyses, with no ICER estimate exceeding £10,000\/QALY gained. In probabilistic sensitivity analysis, the mean ICER was £2502\/QALY gained and ESG remained cost effective in 98.25% of iterations at a willingness-to-pay threshold of £20,000\/QALY. Our study indicates that ESG is highly cost effective versus LM alone for the treatment of adults with class II obesity in England."

Multilevel logistic regression models were developed to examine factors predictive of 5% weight loss.\n \n Results\n Most centers (n = 9) prescribed an 800- to 1000-kcal diet, but the duration and formulation of diet was variable. Overall, 30.6% (n = 510) of patients achieved 5% weight loss during the LRD. After adjustment for preoperative weight, women had reduced odds (odds ratio [OR], .65; 95% confidence interval [CI], .48–.88; P = .005), while increasing age (OR, 1.01; 95% CI, 1.00–1.02; P = .043) and having type 2 diabetes (OR, 1.49; 95% CI, 1.16–1.92; P = .002) increased odds of 5% weight loss.

        "abstract": "Background: Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension (IIH) is a neurometabolic condition severely impacting the quality of life of people living with IIH (PwIIH). Most PwIIH are overweight or live with obesity, and weight loss is recommended by healthcare professionals (HCPs) as it is central to disease management. There is currently no research evaluating patient-clinician interactions when discussing weight management in IIH. The aim of this study was to evaluate the patient experience of communication with HCPs regarding weight management from the perspective of PwIIH.Methods: A cross-sectional online survey was developed and distributed by the IIH UK charity via their mailing list and social media network. Eligible participants were adults with IIH who have been recommended to lose weight by their HCP. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize quantitative responses and content analysis was used to inductively draw out themes from open-ended free-text responses.Results: There were 625 respondents. One fifth of PwIIH (n=127\/603, 21%) felt that HCPs were supportive and empathetic about weight management. Five themes were identified on how experiences regarding weight management for IIH can be improved, with PwIIH recommending for HCPs to: (1) detail the relationship between IIH and weight, (2) individualise care, (3) give advice, (4) provide support, and (5) adapt communication.Conclusion: The majority of PwIIH recalled a poor experience and negative emotions when engaged in discussions regarding weight management with their HCPs. Further research should explore the HCPs perspective and evaluate interventions aiming to improve the quality of patient-HCPs communication in IIH."

        "abstract": "Background and Objectives Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) is associated with obesity, however there is a lack of clinical consensus on how to manage weight in IIH. The aim of this systematic review is to evaluate weight loss interventions in people with IIH to determine which intervention is superior in terms of weight loss, reduction in intracranial pressure, benefit to visual and headache outcomes, quality of life, and mental health.Methods A systematic review was carried out in accordance with PRISMA guidelines and registered with PROSPERO (CRD42023339569). MEDLINE and CINAHL were searched for relevant literature published from inception until 15th December 2022. Screening and quality appraisal was conducted by two independent reviewers. Recommendations were graded using Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN) methodology.Results A total of 17 studies were included. Bariatric surgery resulted in 27.2-27.8kg weight loss at 24 months (Level 1- to 1++). Lifestyle weight management interventions resulted in between 1.4 to 15.7kg weight loss (Level 2+ to 1++). Bariatric surgery resulted in the greatest mean reduction in ICP (-11.9cm H2O) at 24 months (Level 1++), followed by multi-component lifestyle intervention + acetazolamide (-11.2cm H2O) at 6 months (Level 1+), and then a very low energy diet intervention (-8.0cm H2O) at 3 months (Level 2++). The least ICP reduction was shown at 24 months after completing a 12-month multi-component lifestyle intervention (-3.5 cm H2O) (Level 1++). Reduction in body weight was shown to be highly correlated with reduction in ICP (Level 2++ to 1++).Discussion Bariatric surgery should be considered for women with IIH and a BMI ≥35kg\/m2 since this had the most robust evidence for sustained weight management (Grade A). A multi-component lifestyle intervention (diet + physical activity + behaviour) had the most robust evidence for modest weight loss with a BMI <35kg\/m2 (Grade B). Longer term outcomes for weight management interventions in people with IIH are required, to determine if there is a superior weight loss intervention for IIH."

        "abstract": "Background: Bariatric and Metabolic Surgery (BMS) is a popular weight loss intervention worldwide, yet few scientific studies have examined variations in preoperative practices globally. This study aimed to capture global variations in preoperative practices concerning patients planned for BMS. Methods: A 41-item questionnaire-based survey was designed and the survey link was freely distributed on social and scientific media platforms, email groups and circulated through personal connections of authors. The survey included eight parts: basic information; criteria for BMS; preoperative nutritional screening; preoperative weight loss; preoperative diets for liver size reduction; preoperative glycemic control; other laboratory investigations and preparations; decision making, education, and consents. Descriptive statistics were used to analyse data and graphs were used for representation where applicable. Results: Six hundred thirty-four bariatric healthcare professionals from 76 countries\/regions completed the survey. Of these, n = 310 (48.9%) were from public hospitals, n = 466 (73.5%) were surgeons, and the rest were multidisciplinary professionals. More than half of respondents reported using local society\/association guidelines in their practice (n = 310, 61.6%). The great majority of respondents routinely recommend nutritional screening preoperatively (n = 385, 77.5%), mandatory preoperative diets for liver size reduction (n = 220, 53.1%), routine screening for T2DM (n = 371, 90.7%), and mandate a glycemic control target before BMS in patients with T2DM (n = 203, 55.6%). However, less than half (n = 183, 43.9%) recommend mandatory preoperative weight loss to all patients. Most respondents (n = 296, 77.1%) recommend psychological intervention before surgery for patients diagnosed with psychological conditions. Variations were also identified in laboratory investigations and optimisation; and in the aspects of decision making, education and consent. Conclusions: This survey identified significant global variations in preoperative practices concerning patients seeking primary BMS. Our findings could facilitate future research for the determination of best practice in these areas of variations, and consensus-building to guide clinical practice while we wait for that evidence to emerge."

        "abstract": "Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) is more common in women of reproductive age who have obesity, yet there is little information on its management specifically in pregnancy. Women with IIH should plan their pregnancy including discussing contraception before pregnancy, recognising that hormonal contraceptives are not contraindicated. Potentially teratogenic medications including acetazolamide and topiramate are not recommended during pregnancy or in those with immediate plans to conceive; prescribing acetazolamide in pregnancy must only follow discussion with the patient and their obstetrician. Ideally, patients should aim to achieve disease remission or control before pregnancy, through optimising their weight. Although weight gain is expected in pregnancy, excessive weight gain may exacerbate IIH and increase maternal and fetal complications; evidence-based recommendations for non-IIH pregnancies may help in guiding optimal gestational weight gain. The vast majority of women with IIH can have a normal vaginal delivery, with spinal or epidural anaesthesia if needed, provided the papilloedema is stable or the IIH is in remission.

        "abstract": "Background:Low energy diets (LEDs)(1000-1200kcal) and very low energy diets (VLEDs) (<800kcal) have been shown to significantly reduce liver size in preparation for laparoscopic bariatric surgery. However, pre-operative dietary practices vary considerably and research to date has not examined the efficacy of a range of pre-operative diets within clinical practice. Thus, our study aimed to establish the variation in, and efficacy of, pre-operative dietary regimes utilised in practice across the UK.Methods:We conducted a retrospective cohort study of all patients who underwent a primary bariatric procedure at 16 participating UK bariatric centres between 1st January 2019 to 31st December 2019. Patient demographic data (gender, age, ethnicity), diabetes status and weight at baseline and on the day of surgery was collected. We also collected data about the pre-operative diet regimes, including kcals\/day and duration. A multilevel linear random effects model was developed to examine predictors of weight on day of surgery. Baseline weight, diabetes status, diet duration and kcals\/day were included in the model.Results:A total of 2,092 patients were included in the analysis. Diets ranged from <800kcal to >1200kcals\/day and lasted one week to ≥5 weeks. The most common diets followed by patients were 800-1000kcals (55.7%) and lasted 2 weeks (71.4%). The unadjusted mean weight loss across all patients was 5.43kg (95% CI 5.18 to 5.68). Weight on the day of surgery was, on average, 0.79kg less for patients with diabetes compared to those without diabetes (p=0.002), and also less for 4 week (1.90kg, p=0.035) and ≥5 week diets (3.54kg, p=0.001), compared to a 1 week diet. Patients on a <800kcals\/day diet were, on average, 8.86kg lighter than >1200 Kcals\/day diets on the day of surgery (p=0.016). There was no significant difference in weight between VLED of <800kcal\/day diets and LEDs of either 800-1000kcal\/day (p=0.194) or 1000-1200kcal\/day (p=0.212).Conclusions:A range of pre-operative diets are used in clinical practice in the UK, reflecting a need for standardised guidance in this area. Our study found that lower kcal and longer duration pre-operative diets were associated with greater pre-operative weight loss. Further research is required to confirm our findings that patients with diabetes respond better to pre-operative diets and to establish the adequate level of weight loss as proxy for liver shrinkage prior to bariatric surgery."

        "abstract": "Background: Multi-component lifestyle interventions are the first line treatment for obesity. Dietitians are ideally placed healthcare professionals to deliver such interventions. However, only a small proportion of patients with obesity are referred by general practice to dietitians, and the reasons for this are not clear. The present study aimed to explore general practice healthcare professionals’ (GPHCPs) experiences and perceptions of dietitians in the context of obesity management. Methods: A convenience sample of GPHCPs practicing in the UK was recruited via a targeted social media strategy, using virtual snowball sampling. Data were collected using semi-structured interviews and analysed using framework analysis. Results: In total, 20 participants were interviewed (11 general practice nurses and nine general practitioners). Experiences of referring patients with obesity for dietetic intervention resulted in two main themes: (i) access barriers and (ii) the dietetic consult experience. Three themes emerged from participants’ perceptions of a role for general practice dietitians: (i) utilising dietetic expertise; (ii) access to dietitian; and (iii) time. Participants experienced barriers to accessing dietitians for obesity management and felt that having a dietitian working within their general practice team would help address this. Having a dietitian embedded within their general practice team was perceived to have the potential to alleviate GPHCPs’ clinical time pressures, offer opportunities for upskilling, and may improve patient engagement with obesity management. Conclusions: GPHCPs perceived that embedding a dietitian within their general practice team would be valuable and beneficial for obesity management. Our findings provide support for the funding of general practice dietitian roles in the UK."

However, it is not clear whether delivery in a group or one-to-one format influences weight loss efficacy. The present study aimed to systematically review the evidence of the effectiveness of group compared to one-to-one multi-component lifestyle interventions for weight management.METHODS: MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, CENTRAL and ISRCTN databases were searched from inception up to February 2020 for randomised controlled trials comparing group versus one-to-one multi-component lifestyle interventions for weight loss in adults with a body mass index ≥ 25 kg m-2 . The primary outcome was weight loss (kg) at 12 months and the secondary outcome was attainment of ≥5% weight loss at 12 months. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool. Meta-analysis used random effects and estimated risk ratios and continuous inverse variance methods. Heterogeneity was investigated using I2 statistics and sensitivity analyses.RESULTS: Seven randomised controlled trials with 2576 participants were included. Group interventions were favoured over one-to-one interventions for weight loss at 12 months (-1.9 kg, 95% confidence interval = -1.3 to -2.6; I2 = 99%). Participants of group interventions were more likely to attain ≥5% weight loss at 12 months relative to one-to-one interventions (relative risk = 1.58, 95% confidence interval = 1.25-2.00; I2 = 60%).CONCLUSIONS: Group multi-component lifestyle interventions are superior for weight loss compared to one-to-one interventions with respect to adult weight management. Further research is required to determine whether specific components of group interventions can explain the superiority of weight loss outcomes in group interventions."

Aim To investigate whether nutritional and weight monitoring in primary care meets current clinical guidance, after patients are discharged from specialist bariatric care. Design and setting Retrospective cohort study in primary care practices contributing to IQVIA Medical Research Data in the UK (1 January 2000 to 17 January 2018). Method Participants were adults who had had bariatric surgery with a minimum of 3 years’ follow-up post-surgery, as this study focused on patients discharged from specialist care (at 2 years post-surgery). Outcomes were the annual proportion of patients from 2 years post-surgery with a record of recommended nutritional screening blood tests, weight measurement, and prescription of nutritional supplements, and the proportions with nutritional deficiencies based on blood tests. Results A total of 3137 participants were included in the study, and median follow-up post-surgery was 5.7 (4.2–7.6) years. Between 45% and 59% of these patients had an annual weight measurement. The greatest proportions of patients with a record of annual nutritional blood tests were for tests routinely conducted in primary care, for example, recorded haemoglobin measurement varied between 44.9% (n = 629\/1400) and 61.2% (n = 653\/1067). Annual proportions of blood tests specific to bariatric surgery were low, for example, recorded copper measurement varied between 1.2% (n = 10\/818) and 1.5% (n = 16\/1067) where recommended. Results indicated that the most common deficiency was anaemia. Annual proportions of patients with prescriptions for recommended nutritional supplements were low. Conclusion This study suggests that patients who have bariatric surgery are not receiving the recommended nutritional monitoring after discharge from specialist care. GPs and patients should be supported to engage with follow-up care. Future research should aim to understand the reasons underpinning these findings."

Videoconferencing could provide safe remote access to group WMPs during the COVID-19 pandemic. The objectives of this study were to determine the uptake of a virtual group WMP and its predictors. Methods: All patients enrolled on a face-to-face group WMP, which constitutes part of a Tier 3 WMP delivered by the NHS, at the time of the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown were invited to transfer to a virtual format of the group WMP. Baseline data included weight, BMI, age, gender, ethnicity and Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD) quintile score. The outcomes were accept\/decline transfer to the virtual group WMP. Logistic regression was performed to assess for predictors of uptake. Results: The 315 participants were included, of which 72.1% (n = 227) accepted. After adjusting for gender, deprivation and BMI; older patients (OR 0.966, [95% CI 0.944, 0.989]; p = 0.003) and Black, Asian and Minority Ethnicity (BAME) patients (OR 0.460 [95% 0.248, 0.851]; p = 0.023) were less likely to accept the virtual group WMP. Conclusion: Strategies aimed at improving uptake of group WMP among BAME and older adult groups are needed, particularly considering the increased risk of severe COVID-19 in these two groups, and the links between obesity and poor COVID-19 outcomes."

This review seeks to assess the current integrated clinical pathway for obesity management in England and determine the major challenges.                              Recent Findings                Evidence for tier 2 (community-based lifestyle intervention) and tier 3 (specialist weight management services) is limited, and how it facilitates care and improve outcomes in tier 4 remains uncertain. Treatment access, rigidity in pathways, uncertain treatment outcomes and weight stigma seems to be major barriers to improved care.                              Summary                More emphasis must be placed on access to effective treatments, treatment flexibility, addressing stigma and ensuring treatment efficacy including long-term health outcomes. Prevention and treatment should both receive significant focus though should be considered to be largely separate pathways. A simplified system for weight management is needed to allow flexibility and the delivery of personalized care including post-bariatric surgery care for those who need it."

        "abstract": "Background: Many bariatric surgical centers mandate achieving weight loss targets through medical weight management (MWM) programs before offering bariatric surgery, but the evidence for this is unclear. Objectives: To examine the relationship between weight changes during (1) MWM, and (2) preoperative low-energy-diet (LED), and weight changes at 12 and 24 months after surgery. Setting: Multicenter community- and acute-based MWM services referring to one regional bariatric center, United Kingdom. Methods: A retrospective cohort study of patients who attended MWM and then underwent a primary laparoscopic bariatric procedure (adjustable gastric banding [LAGB], or Roux-en-Y gastric bypass [RYGB]) in a single bariatric center in the United Kingdom between 2013 and 2015. Data were collected from patient electronic records. Results: Two hundred eight patients were included (LAGB n = 128, RYGB n = 80). Anthropometric data were available for 94.7% and 88.0% of participants at 12 and 24 months, respectively. There was no relationship between weight loss during MWM and after surgery at either 12 or 24 months. Weight loss during the preoperative LED predicted greater weight loss after LAGB (β = .251, P = .006) and less weight loss after RYGB (β = −.390, P = .003) at 24 months, after adjusting for age, sex, ethnicity, baseline weight, and LED duration. Conclusions: Weight loss in MWM does not predict greater weight loss outcomes up to 24 months after LAGB or RYGB. Greater weight loss during the preoperative LED predicted greater weight loss after LAGB and less weight loss after RYGB. Our results suggest that patients should not be denied bariatric surgery because of not achieving weight loss in MWM. Weight loss responses to preoperative LEDs as a predictor of postsurgical weight loss requires further investigation."

        "abstract": "Introduction: Obesity is common (prevalence 30%) in older adults (≥65 years). Bariatric surgery (BS) is the most effective intervention resulting in sustained weight loss and cardiovascular and metabolic benefits. However, the outcomes of BS in older patients are unknown.Methods: A retrospective study utilising the bariatric database from a single UK NHS BS centre. We identified all older patients, aged ≥65 years old at surgery, who had BS between 2003 and 2013 and all were matched to 2 ‘typical’ aged controls (38 – 53 years old, the age IQR for BS patients at our centre) for surgical procedure, gender, referral body mass index (BMI) and diabetes status. Data were obtained from both local and GP records. Survival was compared between cases and matched controls using Kaplan-Meier estimators and the log rank test up to 5-years post-operatively.Results: The mean age (S.D.) for cases (n=41) and controls (n=82) were 67 (2.3) and 46 years (5.1), respectively. Mean BMI was 47 kg\/m2 (7.2), 34% were men and 59% had Type 2 diabetes. There was 0% mortality in both cases and controls at 30-days post-operative. Over 5-years post-operative follow-up; there was 9.8% (n=4) mortality in older adults (9.8%) 1.2% mortality (n=1) in controls (P=0.03). No deaths were due to surgical complication. At 5-years post-operative, BMI reduction in older adults (7.2±6.1 kg\/m2) was significantly less than younger controls (11.6±8.6 kg\/m2) (t(72)=−2.218, P=0.030). Meanwhile there was no significant difference in change in HbA1c among patients with Type 2 Diabetes (P=0.516).Conclusion: In older adults, BS was not associated with increased 30-day mortality or surgical-related mortality up to 5 years post-surgery. BS resulted in clinically meaningful BMI reductions in older patients at 5 years post-surgery. However, BMI reductions were significantly greater in younger patients at 5 years post-surgery. The impact of surgery on glycaemic control was similar across older and younger adults with Type 2 diabetes. BS is a valid option of treatment in older patients with obesity, future studies need to examine the impact of surgery on functionality and quality of life in this patient group."

        "abstract": "Introduction: Adults living in the most deprived areas of England are more likely to have obesity. However, it is not clear whether social deprivation has an impact on accessing and the outcomes of bariatric surgery. The aim of our study was to explore the effect of indices of deprivation on access to bariatric surgery and its outcomes.Methods: Cross-sectional prospective evaluation in a single centre in England of all patients who underwent primary bariatric surgery in 2016. Deprivation was assessed using the index of multiple deprivation (IMD) (2015), which ranks areas within England from the most (IMD Decile=1) to least deprived (IMD Decile=10). We extracted lower-layer super output area IMD Deciles according to the patients post code at time of bariatric surgery as well as the 12-month post-surgical weight loss and type of surgery.Results: Of the 183 patients who underwent bariatric surgery, 55% (n=102) lived in areas within the 1-3rd IMD Decile (most deprived areas) (27% (4-6th) and 17% (7-10th) IMD Decile). There was no relationship between the type of bariatric surgery offered and IMD Decile. There was no relationship between IMD Decile tertiles (1-3,4-7, 7-10) and % weight loss at one year either across all bariatric surgical interventions (r2=0.019, P=0.09; r2=0.012, P=0.17) or when analysed according to surgery type.Conclusions: People undergoing bariatric surgery typically lived in more deprived areas which might be anticipated by the correlation between deprivation and obesity as well as the relative levels of deprivation within our catchment area suggesting by this measure that deprivation is not a clear barrier to accessing bariatric surgery, however data was not available on patients who did not undergo surgery and this may reveal potential inequalities with accessing bariatric surgery both at the point of referral from primary care as well as in the transition from Tier 3 to Tier 4 services. Deprivation does not seem to have an effect on weight loss at 1 year post bariatric surgery. This data suggests that the bariatric surgery service is accessible to people across all IMD Deciles within our catchment area.Keywords: Obesity, social deprivation, healthcare inequa"

        "abstract": "BackgroundType 2 diabetes (T2DM) is increasing in prevalence worldwide, and is closely linked to obesity. Binge Eating Disorder (BED) and Night Eating Syndrome (NES) are eating disorders that are common in obesity, and may affect the management as well as long term outcomes of T2DM. Therefore, the aim of this review was to assess the prevalence and associations of BED or NES in adults with T2DM.MethodsWe conducted a systematic review. The databases MEDLINE, CINAHL and AMED were searched for articles which met the inclusion criteria; including patients > 18 years old, with T2DM, and BED and\/or NES. The reference lists of included studies were also searched. Meta-analysis was not attempted due to the limited number of studies that measured the outcomes of interest.ResultsA total of 10 studies (2 included NES) were included in this systematic review. The number screened for BED and NES were 6527 and 1039 participants, respectively. Point prevalence was 1.2–8.0% for BED and 3.8–8.4% for NES. Patients with T2DM and BED had higher BMI than patients with T2DM without BED in the two studies that reported BMI. There was no statistically significant difference in HbA1c between patients with and without BED in the two studies that measured HbA1c.ConclusionsBED and NES are common in adults with T2DM, and BED is associated with higher BMI in patients with T2DM. However, only two studies reported important outcomes measures such as BMI and HbA1c in patients with T2DM. Hence, further well-designed studies are needed to assess the impact of BED and NES in patients with T2DM. Health Care Professionals should consider the diagnosis of BED and NES in patients with T2DM."

A total of 45 patients (64.4% women, median [interquartile range] age 49 [45-60] years) were included. The median (interquartile range) weight loss from start of MWM until 12 months post-surgery was 17.9% (13.0%-29.3%). GLP-1RA treatment during MWM resulted in 5.0% (1.9%-7.7%) weight loss. Weight loss during GLP-1RA treatment predicted weight loss from the start of MWM until 12 months post-surgery, but not postoperative weight loss after adjustment. The proportion of weight loss from start of MWM to 12 months post-surgery attributed to GLP-1RA treatment was negatively associated with that attributed to surgery, after adjustment. In conclusion, weight change after GLP-1RA treatment predicted the weight loss achieved by a combination of MWM and bariatric surgery, but not weight loss induced by surgery only. Failure to lose weight after GLP-1RA treatment should not be considered a barrier to undergoing bariatric surgery."

        "abstract": "Utilising multiple disjoint paths in multiple channels can improve network performance by enabling a node to reroute data along discovered paths seamlessly when link failure is detected. However, depending on a stale\/invalid route to recover from a broken link could increase the delay to recover fromthe broken link and degrade the network performance. In this paper, we propose a new MAC protocol (RIVC-MB) to enhance communication reliability in the multipath multichannel routing protocol. The reliability of transmitting\/re-routing the data packet in multipath multichannel routing protocol is improved by providing early route invalidity detection and early switchover. Waiting time to access the medium is also improved, when a node is attempting to access a busy medium, by re-routing the data packet via the alternative route. The RIVC-MB protocol uses the cross-layer interaction between MAC and routing protocols to achieve these goals. The proposed protocol is implemented and extensively evaluated using the NS-2 simulator. Simulation results show that the new proposed protocol improves the endto- end delay, and reduces both the number of route error control packets and the number of dropped data packets in the routing layer. It also reduces reduces the collision rate in the MAC layer in a dense network."

        "abstract": "Utilising multiple channels can increase the wireless ad hoc network capacity. Receiver Directed Transmission protocol (RDT) is designed to provide multichannel access using a single radio interface. RDT introduces a clever approach to support channel assignment and negotiation without relying on a control channel or time synchronisation. Protocols based on the RDT scheme normally use an extra radio interface, dual home channel or time synchronisation to overcome the expected issues in RDT, such as, hidden terminal and deafness problems. This paper demonstrates that using RDT with a single radio and single home channel it is still possible to increase the network capacity. Additionally, the paper investigates the effect of node density, mobility and number of available channels on RDT performance. NS-2 simulator is used to evaluate the proposed scheme. Simulation results confirm that using multichannel RDT scheme can effectively increase the throughput, the packet delivery ratio and reduce the delay compared to single channel protocol."

        "abstract": "The route recovery algorithm is a crucial part of an ad hoc routing protocol. Designing an efficient and fast route recovery mechanism scheme without incurring extra overheads or delays to repair the broken link is a desirable goal for any routing protocol. The route recovery algorithm in reactive routing protocols like AODV occurs only after a link failure is detected. However, we propose a new route discovery mechanism called Route Migration over Multiple link failure in Multi-Channel (RMMMC), which combines multiple paths and channels to provide a disjointed alternative route. When link failure is detected, the RMMMC reroutes the data packet through the alternative route in alternative channels that have been previously discovered. Furthermore, the RMMMC is resilient to multiple link failures. Unlike other route recovery approaches, nodes in RMMMC are considered to be equipped with a single transceiver. The RMMMC scheme is implemented and extensively evaluated by using an ns-2 simulator. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme achieves a better packet delivery ratio, throughput and reduces the routing overhead and end-to-end delay in a dense network."

The paper introduces a new concept of Self-Protocol Trustiness (SPT) in which detecting a malicious intruder is accomplished by complying with the normal protocol behavior and lures the malicious node to give an implicit avowal of its malicious behavior. We present a Blackhole Resisting Mechanism (BRM) to resist such attacks that can be incorporated into any reactive routing protocol. It does not require expensive cryptography or authentication mechanisms, but relies on locally applied timers and thresholds to classify nodes as malicious. No modifications to the packet formats are needed, so the overhead is a small amount of calculation at nodes, and no extra communication.

We searched papers published between January 1981 and December 2023 using academic databases, with the key terms African lion, human–lion conflict, human–lion coexistence, and human–lion interaction. This produced 485 records, reduced to 137 after using additional criteria. Ninety‐eight papers were focused on lions in Kenya, Tanzania, Zimbabwe, and Botswana. Ten pan‐African studies were identified in our review. Our inductive analysis identified four themes related to HLC: attitudes and perceptions toward lions, causes of HLC, consequences of HLC, and mitigating HLC. Some limitations identified in systematic reviews of human–wildlife conflict have been addressed in recent years, such as broadening the geographical scale of research. However, some knowledge gaps remain, including a lack of assessment of mitigation strategies and studies on climate changes impact on human–lion conflict. Addressing the knowledge gaps highlighted in this review will require diversifying the disciplinary composition of the research teams and increasing researcher reflexivity."

        "abstract": "Recent years have seen the proliferation of television broadcasts that focus on the lavish lifestyles and consumption of “rich kids.” However, flaunting inherited wealth is an accountable activity within UK society that claims to be based on meritocratic values. Whilst wealthy individuals are a source of public spectatorship, they are also attributed with contributing to economic inequality and inhibiting social mobility. This study draws on social psychology to examine media representations of wealthy heirs accounting for their wealth in popular programmes about the “super rich.” Forty-one and a half hours of non-subscription UK television data from 2016 that included the term “super-rich” was analysed. Drawing on Discursive Social Psychology, heirs were found to be managing an ideological dilemma of accounting for their inherited privilege while in a (supposedly) meritocratic environment. Heirs use four interpretative repertoires to negotiate their unmeritocratic position: (1) having a fair go, (2) unintentional privilege, (3) constructing wealth as “family money” and (4) sharing wealth with loved ones. These interpretative repertoires downplay privilege by redefining ownership, highlight any work they do, construct them as aspirational and present them as lacking agency. The presentation of heirs in entertainment documentaries maintains the illusion of meritocratic conditions."

Conservation efforts should focus on genetic variability within wild populations when considering reintroduction attempts. We studied two groups of lions from two conservation sites located in Zambia and Zimbabwe to determine their genetic make-up, information that is usually unknown to the sites. In this study, we analysed 17 specimens for cytb and seven microsatellite markers to ascertain family relationships and genetic diversity previously obtained by observational studies. We then produced a standardised haplogroup phylogeny using all available entire mitogenomes, as well as calculating a revised molecular clock. The modern lion lineage diverged ~151 kya and was divided into two subspecies, both containing three distinct haplogroups. We confirm that Panthera leo persica is not a subspecies, but rather a haplogroup of the northern P.l. leo that exited Africa at least ~31 kya. The progenitor to all lions existed ~1.2 Mya, possibly in SE Africa, and later exited Africa and split into the two cave lion lineages ~175 kya. Species demography is correlated to major climactic events. We now have a detailed phylogeny of lion evolution and an idea of their conservation status given the threat of climate change."

        "abstract": "Human-carnivore coexistence (HCC) on agricultural lands affects wildlife and human communities around the world, whereby a lack of HCC is a central concern for conservation and farmer livelihoods alike. For intervention strategies aimed at facilitating HCC to achieve their desired goals it is essential to understand how interventions and their success are perceived by different stakeholders. Using a grounded theory approach, interviews (n=31) were conducted with key stakeholders (commercial livestock farmers, conservationists and protected area managers) involved in HCC scenarios in Limpopo, South Africa. Interviews explored perceptions of successful intervention strategies (aimed at increasing HCC), factors that contribute to perceptions of strategy effectiveness and whether coexistence was a concept that stakeholders considered achievable. The use of grounded theory emphasised the individual nature and previously unexplored facets to HCC experiences. The majority of stakeholders based their measures of success on changes in livestock loss. Concern has been raised over the subjectivity and reliance on recall that this measure involves, potentially reducing its reliability as an indicator of functional effectiveness. However, it was relied on heavily by users of HCC interventions in our study and is therefore likely influential in subsequent behaviour and decision-making regarding the intervention. Nonetheless, perceptions of success were not just shaped by livestock loss but influenced by various social, cultural, economic and political factors emphasising the challenges of defining and achieving HCC goals. Perceptions of coexistence varied; some stakeholders considered farmer-carnivore coexistence to be impossible, but most indicated it was feasible with certain caveats. An important element of inter-stakeholder misunderstanding became apparent, especially regarding the respective perceptions of coexistence and responsibility for its achievement. Without fully understanding these perceptions and their underpinning factors, interventions may be restricted in their capacity to meet the expectations of all interested parties. The study highlights the need to understand and explore the perceptions of all stakeholders when implementing intervention strategies in order to properly define and evaluate the achievement of HCC goals."

However, data quality is at risk when such scales are used without appropriate validation or reliability testing, potentially leading to erroneous interpretation or application of findings. We used 2 online databases (ProQuest Psych Info and Web of Science) to identify published HWI studies that included attitude and tolerance. We analyzed these studies to determine the methods used to measure attitudes or tolerance toward predators and other wildlife; determine the proportion of these methods applying psychometric scales; and evaluate the rigor with which the scales were used by examining whether the psychometric properties of validity and reliability were reported. From 2007 to 2017, 114 published studies were identified. Ninety-four (82%) used questionnaires and many of these (53 [56%]) utilized a psychometric scale. Most scales (39 [74%]) had at least 1 test of reliability reported, but reliance on a single test was notable, contrary to recommended practice. Fewer studies (35 [66%]) reported a test of validity, but this was primarily restricted to structural validity rather than more comprehensive testing. Encouragingly, HWI investigators increasingly utilized the necessary psychometric tools for designing and analyzing questionnaire data, but failure to assess the validity or reliability of psychometric scales used in over one-third of published HWI attitude research warrants attention. We advocate incorporation of more robust application of psychometric scales to advance understanding of stakeholder attitudes as they relate to HWI."

        "abstract": "A matter of prideWhy are lions and the groups they live in a good focus of research for a social psychologist?Hands up, who hasn’t been told to go to a conference to ‘network’ at some point in their academic career. Getting yourself connected into influential social networks can pay dividends both professionally and personally.In 2013 I took a leap, changed direction, and forged a research career as a social psychologist in lion conservation. Excited by an opportunity I’d been given in Zambia and Zimbabwe to do exactly that, I packed my bags. However, I was warned that there were obstacles to my acceptance amongst fellow lion conservationists. I had the wrong PhD. Mine was in psychology. Worse, it was in social psychology! I was urged to enrol for another PhD in wildlife conservation or something ‘biological’ to ingratiate myself into the influential network of movers and shakers within the lion conservation world. My social science background was irrelevant. How rude. How ironic.Thankfully, wildlife conservation now focuses on working with local communities to develop initiatives that ensure those who live with the risks of protecting a species also receive benefits from doing so. Having unfenced lions living as your neighbour is not on most people’s wish-lists. We’re developing educational and social programmes that enhance local communities’ access to employment and sustainable income revenues, reducing the need to depend on natural resources to forge a living. These include conservation education, where feasible solutions to mitigating conflict with lions are developed and implemented, without loss to people and an increasingly diminishing lion population.Here the application of psychology seems obvious. But what about the lions themselves? Well, lions live in groups. Social psychologists know a thing or two about groups.Social network analysis (SNA) has a long history within the social sciences. SNA defines a plethora of methods that share a basic premise: social connectedness with others matters. The more networked in you are, communicating with others, the better your access and influence over information. You can see why the social sciences have embraced SNA to explore relationships of communication and power across a variety of domains.Within the field of animal behaviour, researchers such as Jens Krause have realised the utility of SNA to examine social cohesion and hierarchies amongst non-human animals. If we think of groups as powerful social networks, and assume the players within them are not equal, this might hold the key to understanding how some animal societies function – which might prove crucial for their effective conservation.Lion prides describe adult females and their cubs. Males can take over a pride and hold tenure for two to three years (sometimes longer), but will eventually be overthrown by fitter males seeking the opportunity to breed and enjoy the benefits of group living including cooperation in nurturing young, hunting and territorial defence. A lion’s chance of success in the wild is improved by pride living. So, to protect lions, we should focus on pride structure and function to maximise their chances.Considering conservationPrides have tended to be taken for granted in the research literature. They exist. There has been little focus on how they exist, how they are sustained, and the roles of the lions within them. Andrew Sih and colleagues describe ‘keystone’ individuals in SNA; the ‘social glue’ of a group because of their tight connections with all others within the networks. In its simplest form: Individuals A and B might not be friends with each other, but they are connected through a relationship they both have with C. That makes C key to holding the group together.I’ve been lucky enough to spend time with lion prides and study their behaviour to examine their structure and function. Each pride has an adult female ‘keystone’ member who ‘glues’ the pride together. She holds the most social connections, is the best networked individual, and the most socially influential. She dictates the pride’s movements. Identifying and protecting these keystones is crucial if we are to maintain the integrity of wild prides. Removal of the keystone can lead to the break-up of the group if no other lion steps up to the plate. If we consider that key threats to lions include persecution and disease, keystones can be prime targets. Efforts to restore lions include the translocation of lions across areas, and the reintroduction of lions to the wild. These efforts must identify and understand the structure of prides to ensure crucial social networks are protected in that process.As psychologists know, social networks matter. Including psychology into wildlife conservation networks might prove key to protecting this diverse field."

Prior to release, long-term monitoring and assessment of behavior is required to determine whether prides and coalitions behave naturally and are sufficiently adapted to a wild environment. Social network analysis (SNA) can be used to provide insight into how the pride as a whole and individuals within it, function. Our study was conducted upon 2 captive-origin prides who are part of an ex situ reintroduction program, and 1 wild pride of African lion. Social interactions were collected at all occurrence for each pride and categorized into greet, social grooming, play, and aggression. Betweenness centrality showed that offspring in each pride were central to the play network, whereas degree indicated that adults received (indegree) the greatest number of overall social interactions, and the adult males of each pride were least likely to initiate (outdegree) any interactions. Through the assessment of individual centrality and degree values, a social keystone adult female was identified for each pride. Social network results indicated that the 2 captive-origin prides had formed cohesive social units and possessed relationships and behaviors comparable with the wild pride for the studied behaviors. This study provided the first SNA comparison between captive-bred origin and a wild pride of lions, providing valuable information on individual and pride sociality, critical for determining the success of prides within an ex situ reintroduction program."

Behaviours were analysed via linear mixed models, using restricted maximum-likelihood analysis. Age, sex, origin, time observed and vegetation type were fitted as fixed factors to assess the main effects of significant interactions, while average temperature was fitted as a covariate. Resting and alert behaviours were found to vary at sex and age levels, with expected peaks and lows coinciding with observation session times. Captive-origin prides showed a decrease in resting and increase in alert and movement behaviours post 1700 hours, while this behavioural change was not observed for the wild prides. Males of the wild prides were observed to rest more than captive-origin counterparts, while this variation was not observed for females across origins. Vegetation was found to influence behaviour, with cubs being more alert and active in riverbed vegetation, and adults and sub-adults in shrubland. Overall, all prides were observed to exhibit behaviours at natural levels. This study provides a comprehensive assessment of the daily activity of lions critical to the pre-release evaluation of prides within an ex situ reintroduction program."

The survey aimed to assist proposed future monitoring exercises by defining the geographical extent that should be considered to improve accuracy in species abundance estimates. Results were supplemented using collected indications of elephant presence from prior monitoring exercises, and during this survey. Elephant presence was confirmed up to 8 km from the boundary of the protected core habitat, focussed in: (1) an unfenced zone of the national park, (2) along a road leading from the national park to the Dambwa Forest to the north and (3) along two rivers located to the west (Sinde River) and east (Maramba River) of the core area. Detection probability of elephant presence was high using these methods, and we recommend regular sampling to determine changes in habitat use by elephants, as humans continue to modify land-use patterns."

It examines the effectiveness of an intervention in redressing attitudes and behaviours to mitigate night-time conflict between rural communities and wild lions, reducing livestock losses to lions and retaliation killings of lions. Sixteen farms based in the Matetsi Conservancy, Zimbabwe, in human-wildlife conflict areas took part.MethodsFlashing lights were installed on their livestock kraals, matched with 16 ‘hotspot’ homesteads without lights.  Numbers of attacks before and after the intervention were recorded.  Camera-traps were positioned around each kraal to monitor lion activity.  A conservation education programme was delivered to 67 children living in the area.  Attitudes before and after the intervention were recorded using the Attitudes to Conservation and the Environment (ACE) questionnaire.  The ACE comprises 20 items to measure sub-Saharan African children’s attitudes to their environment and to problem animals.  Participants rated items from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree).  Behaviours monitored through self-report.  Incidences of lion attacks on livestock recorded using diaries kept by farmers before and after the intervention.FindingsIncidences on livestock significantly reduced in lit farms but unchanged on unlit. Attitudes to lions were 3.7 before, 4.0 immediately afterwards and 4.1, 3 months later with the difference between pre and delayed post approaching significance (p=.086). Self-reported behaviours noted improved husbandry practices.DiscussionWe conclude a multi-disciplinary approach incorporating social psychology is vital to address the human-side of wildlife conservation."

Resting behavior and received play interactions were correlated in 2 captive-origin prides and one wild pride, attributable to the involvement of cubs and sub-adults.

Data were collected via direct observations, while a species-specific protocol for testing boldness, using playbacks, was developed. Differences in sex, age and session time for the activity budget were evaluated using Pearson correlations and repeated-measures ANOVA, while social interactions were analysed using social network analysis. Spearman’s correlations were conducted to assess for associations between boldness scores, activity and sociality. The two boldness tests provided a range of scores per lion, indicating that the test was effective. Correlations and variations in individual behaviour indicated that adults and sub-adults have specific roles within pride behaviour. Correlations between boldness and activity and social behaviours provided information on the role of individuals, allowing investigation into the behaviour of a dominant and a social keystone.

In response to the rapid decline of wild African lion (Panthera leo) populations, an array of conservational strategies have been adopted. Ex situ reintroduction of the African lion requires the construction of socially cohesive pride structures prior to wild release. This pilot study adopted a social network theory approach to quantitatively assess a captive pride's social structure and the relationships between individuals within them. Group composition (who is present in a group) and social interaction data (social licking, greeting, play) was observed and recorded to assess social cohesion within a released semi-wild pride. UCINET and SOCPROG software was utilised to represent and analyse these social networks. Results indicate that the pride is socially cohesive, does not exhibit random associations, and the role of socially influential keystone individuals is important for maintaining social bondedness within a lion pride.

We illustrate how they mobilise global categorisation (all humanity) and use various forms of denial to deal with their non-involvement. Having analyzed representative fragments of their prejudice avoidance talk, we conclude with some observation about the strategic deployment of categories and denial forms as part of identity management talk. In contrast to quantitative research that oversimplifies the ingroup-outgroup distinction, we show how the status and outgroupness levels of the needy appear to be both flexible and intricate, which depends on the often-ignored intersecting cultural factors, like the respondents' and victims' ethnic, racial and religious identities."

Identity is a cornerstone of social psychological explanations of helping behaviour but has not been understood in relation to human–animal relationships. Open-ended questionnaires were administered to 111 volunteers working in a range of international conservation projects aimed at protecting endangered animals. Participants were asked their reasons for volunteering, choice of project, experiences and expectations. Thematic textual analysis explored common features across the dataset. Themes identified were identifying with animals, humans dominating nature and collective identity with the organization and fellow volunteers. The paper suggests social psychological knowledge about helping behaviour be applied to understand human–animal interactions to offer insight into the conditions under which we will engage with conservational and environmental concerns and provide aid. Social psychology has been slow to apply its knowledge to an examination of human responses to the challenge of loss of biodiversity. To act, humans must identify with those they seek to protect."

        "abstract": "The persistence of traditional monarchies in modern societies, which are otherwise characterized by democratic and egalitarian values, remains a paradox in the social sciences. In part this is attributable to the lack of psychological investigation into the relationship between subject and sovereign, and in particular the ways in which the political and social values of the citizenry shape understandings of a hereditary monarch's right to represent a national community. Adopting the qualitative analysis methods of discursive psychology and grounded theory, the current study examines vernacular accounts of nationhood and monarchy in England in both formalized conversational interviews (n = 60) and impromptu street interviews (n = 56). Focusing on accounts of Prince Charles's recent proposal to change the role of the monarch, from “Defender of the (Christian) Faith” to “Defender of Faiths,” those in favor treated it as a positive step towards reflecting a diverse (religious) community, bringing the monarchy into line with current concerns of pluralism and upholding values of personal choice and individual rights. Participants who rejected the proposed change in title construed it as antithetical to these values in terms of reflecting personal stake and interest, an abuse of power, or an imposition on other faiths. In all accounts, the prime concern was in safeguarding the political and social values of the citizenry. In conclusion it is argued that the study of subjects' relationship to the monarch, its function and legitimacy, can provide an opportunity to examine how values can characterize a national community and facilitate national diversity."

        "abstract": "Although the study of national identity in social psychology has examined the various ways in which the national group is ‘imagined’, little attention has been paid to the many collective national commemorations, celebrations and rituals of state assumed to unite the nation. This is surprising given the number of celebrations and commemorations which fill the calendars of modern nations throughout the world and which are assumed by social scientists to play some part in the reproduction of the national community. Taking the British Royal Golden Jubilee celebrations of 2002, the present study examines how understandings of Anglo-British national identity are manifest in conversational interviews during and after these events. In line with previous examinations of Anglo-Britishness, our respondents typically resisted imagining the national community as a homogenous whole and distanced themselves from depictions of the Jubilee as a nationalistic event. Support for the Jubilee was contingent upon the event being apolitical and inclusive. We suggest that such collective national events could potentially facilitate ways of imagining the national community in terms of diversity and inclusivity rather than homogeneity and exclusivity."

        "abstract": "Within social psychology, studies of the nation have typically been understood in terms of national identity. Criticisms have been made of the tendency to conflate ‘being’ a member of a national category with psychological attachment to the group and its members. Furthermore, ethnomethodologically informed approaches have argued that little has been said about when and how social actors frame matters as one of national identity. Taking the example of national football support, this study considers the circumstances under which football may be cast as a matter of national identity, and when such ascriptions are resisted. Interviews were conducted with participants born and resident in England and Scotland, whereas in Scotland national football support is treated as a matter of national identity for Scottish and English people, in England it is separated from a collective sense of English identity. Adopting a discursive analytic stance, this study examines the internal and external attribution of national stereotypes and considers their role in managing issues of social causality, justification of in-group behaviour, and the differentiation of national groups."

Instead, this commentary aims to situate both papers within a broader frame of contemporary, primarily British social psychology, to ponder the circumstances that gave rise to them and their implications for social psychologists, discursive and non-discursive, alike. We have organized this commentary into two parts. The first part considers two simple questions. First, why does Corcoran critique DPEC for failing to do things that other discursive approaches provide for? And, second, why does Corcoran take DPEC research to task for having too little potential for or made too little contribution to improving the lives and subjectivities of people in general? These two questions are not unrelated, but for clarity's sake we will try to answer them separately. The second part of this commentary will consider the influence of discursive psychology on social psychology more generally."

        "abstract": "Researchers have argued that, depending on the framing of the Northern Ireland conflict, each group could either be a minority or a majority relative to the other. This complicates macrosocial explanations of the conflict which make specific predictions on the basis of minority or majority positions. The present paper argues that this conundrum may have arisen from the inherent variability in microidentity processes that do not fit easily with macroexplanations. In this paper the rhetoric of relative group position is analysed in political speeches delivered by leading members of an influential Protestant institution in Northern Ireland. It is apparent that minority and majority claims are not fixed but are flexibly used to achieve local rhetorical goals. Furthermore, the speeches differ before and after the Good Friday Agreement, with a reactionary “hegemonic” Unionist position giving way to a “majority-rights power sharing” argument and a “pseudo-minority” status giving way to a “disempowered minority” argument. These results suggest a view of the Northern Ireland conflict as a struggle for “symbolic power,” i.e., the ability to flexibly define the intergroup situation to the ingroup's advantage."

People with far-right political affiliations did generally use national football support to symbolise a general pride in English national identity. However, other people either claimed not to support the England national team precisely because of its associations with nationalism, or else bracketed the domain of football support from more general connotations of English patriotism."

        "abstract": "At the time of the devolution settlement in the UK, there was widespread concern that the establishment of the Scottish Parliament and National Assembly for Wales would prompt a rise in English identity at the expense of British identity and, in turn, threaten polyethnic constructions of citizenship. Such presumptions typically rested on reified understandings of the category labels British and English, and conflated the construct of national identity with the constructs of territorial belonging, social inclusion and citizenship. Post-devolution survey data do not currently reveal a decline in British identity in England. Measures of attachment to Englishness vary as a function of ethnic origin of respondent, but also as a function of question wording. A qualitative interview study of young adult Pakistani-origin Muslims in Greater Manchester, north-west England, illustrates how Englishness may be understood to pertain variously to an exclusive cultural or racial category, or to an inclusive territorial entity or community of political interest. Ethnic constructions of English identity need not imply exclusive understandings of citizenship, but their meaning depends crucially on the ways in which nationality and identity are in turn understood in relation to matters of polity and civil society. Conversely, inclusive understandings of national identity do not guarantee the existence of effective ethnic integration or substantive ethnic equality."

In Scotland, spontaneous accounts of Empire were typically formulated in conjunction with nationalist moral meta-narratives. Respondents variously inferred heroic national character from Scotland's role in Empire, or cast Scottish history as an enduring struggle between progressive forces of nationalism and atavistic forces of Anglo-British colonialism. The construct of Britishness was often seen to derive from, and to be synonymous with, the history of Empire. In England, the Empire story tended to be framed within anti-nationalist meta-narratives. Imperialism was generally understood to represent a product of excessive nationalism, and tales of Empire were used to draw exemplary moral lessons concerning the deficiencies of Anglo-British national character and of the catastrophic consequences of the pursuit of national self-interest more generally. The existence of Britain, and the construct of Britishness, were generally understood to both predate and postdate the history of Empire."

First, that social actors may, on some occasions, act to defend not only themselves, but also others from charges of prejudice. Second, that over the course of any social encounter, interactants may take joint responsibility for policing conversation and for correcting and suppressing the articulation of prejudiced talk. Third, that a focus on the dialogic character of conversation affords an appreciation of the ways in which the status of any particular utterance, action or event as ‘racist’ or ‘prejudiced’ may constitute a social accomplishment. Finally, we note the logical corollary of these observations – that in everyday life, the occurrence of ‘racist discourse’ is likely to represent a collaborative accomplishment, the responsibility for which is shared jointly between the person of the speaker and those other co-present individuals who occasion, reinforce or simply fail to suppress it."

In this article we examine the role of interviewer self-disclosure using data drawn from three projects involving interviews with young people. We consider how an interviewer's attempts to ‘do similarity’ may be interpreted variously as displays of similarity or, ironically, as indicators of difference by the participant, and map the implications that this may have for subsequent interview dialogue. A particular object of concern relates to the ways in which self-disclosing acts may function in the negotiation of category entitlement within interview interactions."

Respondents in Scotland used island imagery to distinguish their political commitment to British citizenship from questions relating to their subjective identity. Respondents in England used island imagery to distinguish the United Kingdom as a distinctive political entity whilst avoiding allusions to a common or distinctive identity or character on the part of the citizenry. People who had moved from England to Scotland used island imagery to manage the delicate task of negotiating rights to social inclusion in Scottish civil society whilst displaying recognition of the indigenous population's claims to distinctive national culture and identity."

Although in explicit talk about ‘the country’ the soldiers typically downplayed the importance of ‘serving the country’ as motivation, in discussing the prospect of a European army the national basis of armies was taken for granted. The findings are discussed in terms of the problematic nature of displays of English ‘patriotism’ or ‘pride’.

The parliamentary debates at the 'peak' of the BSE crisis occurred between 20 and 25 March 1996. Within this time span the European Union ban upon the import and export of British beef was imposed. Whilst many theorists have noted that the introduction of the EU ban led to a change in emphasis within media reports, from health and science to national identity, there has been no work that considers how or why this was accomplished in the political debates themselves. At the heart of the parliamentary debates about BSE lies the question of blame. Arguments concerning whose fault the BSE crisis was and the legitimacy of particular kinds of information and action were highly contentious issues during 1996. It is argued that this attribution and avoidance of blame is linked to the construction and invocation of scientific and national identities within political debates."

        "abstract": "We examine critically the two traditions of work that have informed discursive approaches to identity: social constructionism and conversation analysis. Within both strands, identity is theorized as a flexible phenomenon that is situated in conversations. But although constructionists locate identity within the social, such work remains at a theoretical and rather abstract level and often fails to interrogate the discursive practices through which identity is constituted. Conversely, this attention to the occasioning of identity in everyday talk is precisely the focus of the second, conversation analytic strand of work. Whereas constructionists attend to the wider cultural positioning of identities, conversation analysts resist commenting upon the social significance of what is constructed in interaction. Conversation analysis is therefore limited by its restricted notion of culture in the study of the situated social self. Despite the apparent conflict between these approaches, we suggest that a synthesis of the two provides a comprehensive framework for analysing identity. Drawing upon the BBC Panorama interview between Martin Bashir and Princess Diana, we explore how culturally situated identities are located in this conversational context. We conclude that analysts must not only attend to the micro-level organization of identities but also engage in a wider understanding of the cultural framework within which they are located."

In particular, we explore how involved speakers routinely allocate and avoid blame in everyday talk. In considering such a problematic notion of social interaction, we analyse the BBC interview between Princess Diana and Martin Bashir that was aired on British national television on 20 November 1995. In the analysis, we consider how different discursive strategies are employed by speakers in ways that work up credible and authentic accounts. More specifically, we argue that Diana attributes blame to external `others' within a negotiated context of routine description of past events. Categories such as `the media', `the royal household' and `Charles' are constructed and made relevant throughout the interview and the analytic interest is what is accomplished rhetorically for both Diana and Bashir. Of further interest is the overall script design of the interview and how devices such as script formulation, stake management, footing shifts and progressive narrative function in the negotiation of blame. We conclude that `doing blaming' is attended to and managed locally by participants in conversation and this `doing' can be accomplished in a number of ways."

Scottish subjects stereotyped their own national group in three between-subject conditions: after rating the English, after rating the Greeks, and in isolation (i.e. without explicit reference to any other category). Following the logic of self-categorization theory (Turner, Hogg, Oakes, Reicher & Wetherell, 1987; Turner, Oakes, Haslam & McGarty, 1994), we predicted that the Scottish self-stereotype would depend on the frame of reference created by the experimental manipulations. Further we predicted that changes in the definition of this stereotype would be dimension specific. In other words, stereotype variation was predicted to be contingent upon the relevance of the dimension of judgment for capturing the differences between the Scottish and the category constituting the frame of reference. These predictions were confirmed. As these data were obtained in a context where quite specific predictions about the nature and form of stereotype variation were possible, these data confirm and extend Haslam, Turner, Oakes, McGarty & Hayes' (1992) analysis of the context dependence of stereotypes."

When Permaculture Principles are used in the creation of water purification and harvesting systems, there can be multiple environmental and economic benefits. In the context of energy descent, it may be considered desirable to treat wastewater using minimal energy. The constructed wetland design presented here is a low-entropy system in which wastewater is harvested and transformed into lush and productive wetland, eliminating the requirement for non-renewable energy in water purification, and also maximising benefits: biodiversity, flood resilience and yield. In permaculture design, the high concentrations of nitrogen and phosphorous compounds in sewage are viewed as valuable nutrients, resources to be harvested by a constructed wetland ecosystem and converted into useful yield. Similarly, rainwater runoff is not viewed as a problem which can cause flooding, but as a potential resource to be harvested to provide a yield. This paper presents a case study, with both water quality and productivity data, from Brookside Farm UK, where the use of Permaculture Design Principles has created a combined wastewater management and purification system, accepting all site water."

The African Union (AU) and all its Member States have endorsed these global goals. As Africa has huge renewable energy resources, African countries are uniquely placed to gain from the CET and climate action to combat climate change. This is possible if reasonable steps are taken by relevant stakeholders to achieve the global goals. However, Africa is equally vulnerable to the several cybersecurity challenges that bedevil the CET. While African countries are deploying innovative technologies of renewable energy, they are also in the process of establishing different levels of new attack surfaces for use by cybercriminals. Some of the cybersecurity challenges that threaten the achievement of CET include data security, infrastructure security, and supply chain security. This chapter makes novel contribution to energy transition discourse by providing germane perspectives with which relevant stakeholders in Africa such as policymakers and enforcement authorities can use to develop a regulatory and legal framework that harnesses cybersecurity in the sustainable energy ecosystem of Africa. Such a framework is critical to sustainably protect energy ecosystem from cyber threats in Africa."

        "abstract": "In 2018, the African Union adopted the Agreement on the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) with the aim of creating a common market for goods and services that would serve over 1.3 billion people in Africa. This is a paradigm shift towards a deeper continental integration in Africa whereby AfCFTA would be one of the biggest multilateral trading areas in the world. Although AfCFTA pursues sustainable development goals that embed reducing carbon dioxide emissions in line with international legal instruments on sustainability which applies to Member States of the WTO too, the legal provisions of AfCFTA and WTO that link trade and CET appear rather weak. This article provides a comparative analysis of AfCFTA and WTO legal frameworks with a focus on relationships, challenges and opportunities that incentivise clean energy transition (CET) as part of their sustainability agenda. The article contributes to the discourse on the interplay between regional trade and global trade laws in relation to climate change and sustainable development. As no previous study has compared the legal dynamics of the WTO and AfCFTA in relation to CET, the article provides a novel contribution to the efforts of unlocking the development potential of AfCFTA while enhancing global and regional multilateral trading systems."

        "abstract": "Purpose: This paper aims to investigate and provide pathways for leveraging the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD’s) Ten Global Principles (TGPs) for countering tax crimes in the EU. Design\/methodology\/approach: The study is guided by the combination of traditional and innovative research methods drawn from criminal law and justice, public regulatory theory and tax law, based on socio-legal and comparative methodologies. Findings: The research shows that EU has achieved considerable amount of progress when it comes to meeting the TGPs. However, law and practice in EU Member States indicate that there are different legal, human and organisational approaches to fighting tax crimes. The TGPs could be strategically applied to complementing the EU’s Fifth Anti-Money Laundering Directive (AMLD) and other initiatives on Administrative Cooperation. Research limitations\/implications: Although the TGPs appear encompassing, there are opportunities to harness the potency of these principles and to provide more tailored principles that can help engineer sustainable remedies for countering tax crimes in the EU. Practical implications: The paper critically analyses, through a multidisciplinary approach, the main legal, human and organisational factors influencing the prosecution of tax crimes in the EU Member States. Social implications: Realignment and harmonisation of tax enforcement paractices in the EU Member States thus help in the reduction of tax gap resulting from tax offences. Originality\/value: The paper provides novel approaches and findings based on empirical info obtained from face-to-face focus groups with end users and law enforcement agencies in tax enforcement eco-system in ten different EU Member States."

        "abstract": "The UK is believed to hold prolific reserves of shale gas; the quality of which has been compared and sometimes branded superior to the much successful US shale plays. Nonetheless, after more than ten years since the 13th Onshore Licensing Round, the fracking industry is said to have benefited from just £400 million - £500 million of estimated investments and only one partially fracked well with yet an uncertain fate of commercial production. This paradox motivated the current research. Based on a discounted cash flow model, the economic feasibility of the tax regime was evaluated with a  special interest in the pad allowance [PA], a major incentive of the fiscal regime. We find that the design of the fiscal regime well achieves the Government's financial objectives, but fails to support shale gas investments at lower gas prices. PA introduces further variability in investor cash flows, ultimately defeating the ethos of the incentive. We propose a reduction in the overall tax rate from 40% to no more than 21%; a removal of the additional tax charge (Supplementary Charge) and an amendment of PA rules to; (1) allow an extension of RFES to PA; (2) permit transfer of activated PA across companies in the same group; and (3) redefine capital expenditure to include intermediate well retirement costs necessary to drill new wells to stimulate production. Such a tax strategy would simplify and align the UK fiscal regime with practices across the US, China, Algeria and Canada. Importantly, it would better match the risk of shale gas investments to its rewards and could better attract investments. We recommend the strategy for emerging unconventional oil and gas producing countries for an efficient design of their fiscal regimes."

        "abstract": "Many aspects of the present and future effects on the UK economy, industry, and households, of Brexit have been researched. One thing which appears certain about Brexit is the shadow of uncertainty it casts on the future of business in the UK and its telling effects on the UK economy. It is believed that Brexit has negatively affected the level of investments in the UK, including investments in energy and crucially the upstream oil and gas, with the UK North Sea being starved of investments since 2014, leading already to increased energy bills. The UK is a net importer of natural gas—a major source of its energy, with some dependence on supplies from interconnectors from Europe. At the same time, UK energy companies participate in the common energy market which enables them to undertake arbitrage trading under the common market rules. However, both of these benefits could be lost under a Brexit scenario where the UK and EU come to a no-deal or hard border arrangement. Meanwhile, domestic production of energy in the UK has declined for nearly two decades now and import bills for natural gas are growing—they were £14.2 billion in 2017; £11.7 billion in 2016 and £13.4 billion in 2015—with Government projections indicating an upward trajectory for natural gas imports. It is however believed that the UK has great potential to exploit shale gas to her advantage in order to reduce her reliance on foreign energy which is: (1) less predictable in terms of supply and price affordability and (2) dependent on exchange rates—a primary means through which energy prices increased in 2016\/17 post-Brexit referendum vote. The current study extends discussions on shale gas to cover a review of the potential of natural gas from shale formations to cushion UK households against further erratic gas prices due to Brexit and also assesses the potential effects Brexit may have had on the level of investments in shale gas, in order to suggest policy options for government consideration. Contrary to popular studies, we find evidence to suggest that shale gas has the potential to reduce energy prices for UK businesses and households at commercial extractions, under both hard and soft Brexit scenarios, but with more benefits under hard Brexit. Importantly, we find that from 2008 to 2017, average UK net export of natural gas was 5,191 GWh per year to the EU. We also find and argue that Brexit may have starved the nascent fracking industry of investments in a similar way it did to investments in conventional oil and gas and could have increased investor risk premium for shale gas development, the ultimate effect of which was a categorisation of fracking (company stock) as riskier asset for investors on the London Stock Exchange. We recommend that shale gas development be expedited to maximise its benefits to UK energy consumers post-Brexit or economic benefits from the resource could be diminished by rising operator costs due to delays and effects of the public’s perceived negative opinion of the method of extraction."

        "abstract": "Due to increasing demand for natural gas in Indonesia, the Government now promotes exploration for coalbed methane (CBM). Currently, Indonesia has 453 trillion cubic feet (TCF) of CBM reserves. However, CBM development in the country is still in the exploration phase, with significant under-investment. To attract investors, a tailored Production Sharing Contracts (PSC) regime is required. Based on a combination of Factor Analysis (FA), Discounted Cash Flows (DCF) and Parameter Sensitivity Analysis, the research explores an optimal scenario of a company’s share of revenue that optimised CBM development contracts. We find that a combination of 5 years straight line depreciation (SLD), 5% First Tranche Petroleum (FTP), 78% Contractor Share (CS) and 35% income tax best spreads the risk of CBM development and exploitation between the government and the contractor. This combination is a more suitable PSC regime for developing CBM in an early stage of the industry. Therefore, the Government must cede some taxes during exploration to incentivise CBM development. Three PSCs regimes are thus required to fully develop and exploit CBM, including exploration, transitional and exploitation phase PSCs which better match contractor risks and returns and ensure reasonable certainty of contractor cost recovery."

        "abstract": "Human factors and process safety management (PSM) have become key factors in preventing exposure to both hazardous materials and major accidents. Therefore, comprehensive process safety management is required to address all aspects of human factors. Currently, there are six-process safety management models all of which have some weaknesses with respect to the control of human factors inherent in the process industry.  Moreover,there is as yet no universally accepted process safety management model that treats process safety management as an integral part of the management system. Therefore, a need has arisen to integrate human factors and the existing framework and models into a single integrated management system to ensure a holistic approach of control and a continuous learning system. This paper identifies the missing human factors in the current system and describes an integrated process safety management system (IPSMS) model drawn from screening all existing PSM frameworks, while integrating the Human Factors Analysis and Classification System (HFACS). The model, which adopts the PLAN, DO, CHECK and ACT framework, also outlines an implementation strategy. We conclude that IPSMS provides both a theoretical and a practical framework with which to manage, measure and analyse process safety management systems."

        "abstract": "Oil and gas resources present enormous opportunities for the economic development of low income economies, but poor management of these resources can result in dire consequences for the foundations of the resource-endowed nation. The discovery of oil and gas in Ghana is as significant as the policies and measures to ensure optimum benefits to the nation. This paper evaluates the sustainability of petroleum production in the light of the medium term policy structure, the Ghana Shared Growth and Development Agenda (GSGDA). In particular, the economic contribution of oil and gas to Ghana’s GDP and sustainable investment options for petroleum revenues were examined using ordinary least squares (OLS) regression. The evidence suggests that at current production levels, petroleum is not a significant contributor to Ghana’s GDP after adjusting for the contribution from other sectors of the economy. The consistent appreciation of Ghana’s real effective exchange rate between 2010 and 2013 led to a deterioration of the competitiveness of the non-oil sector and declining contribution of the agricultural sector to GDP; and further eroded the net impact of petroleum production. Investing petroleum proceeds in the non-oil sector and expansion of the export base are a viable option for utilising petroleum revenues."

        "abstract": "This paper articulates the potential implications of Brexit on energy policy and security in the United Kingdom (UK). Given the uncertainties associated with the decision to leave the European Union (EU), the need to consider its potential effects on the UK’s energy sector becomes even more pertinent. Through the lens of a few widely reviewed trade regimes in the light of Brexit, it can be observed that while UK energy policies are unlikely to change drastically, Brexit nevertheless threatens the UK’s capacity to safeguard its energy supply. The uncertainties following Brexit could arguably starve the UK’s upstream petroleum, electricity, and renewable energy sectors of their required investments. Both short and long-term impacts could result in UK residents paying more per unit of energy consumed in a “hard Brexit” scenario, where the UK exits the Internal Energy Market (IEM) and must trade with the EU under World Trade Organisation rules. While a hard Brexit could aid the growth of the nascent shale gas industry, a negotiated withdrawal that includes some form of access to the IEM (a “soft Brexit”) would be more beneficial for the future of energy security in the UK."

Empirical data on WTI price and crude US Crude Oil inventories were analysed using an OLS regression, cointegration, VECM and Ex-post forecast techniques. The findings provide evidence of an inelastic relationship in which a 1% increase in U.S crude oil inventories is associated with 0.46% decrease in WTI crude oil prices; however this was only valid for 22% of WTI crude oil price variations. We also find that past data of U.S crude oil inventories could be used to predict future WTI crude oil prices movement. However, as opposed to literature, the results of VECM analysis indicated there is no short-run relationship between both variables over the trajectory"

        "abstract": "The UK has had its fair share of the shale gas revolutionary waves blowing across the global oil and gas industry at present. Although, its exploitation is widely agreed to have been delayed, shale gas was looked upon favorably by the UK Parliament when they recognized it as genuine energy source and granted licenses to industry to search and extract the resource. This, although a significant progress by industry, there yet remains another test the UK fracking resource must pass in order to render shale gas extraction feasible – it must be economically extractible and sustainably so. Developing unconventional resources is much more expensive and risky, and for shale gas wells, producing in commercial volumes is conditional upon drilling horizontal wells and hydraulic fracturing, techniques which increase CAPEX. Meanwhile, investment in shale gas development projects is sensitive to gas price and technical and geological risks. Using a Two-Factor Model, the economics of the Bowland shale wells were analyzed and the operational conditions under which fracking is profitable in the UK was characterized. We find that there is a great degree of flexibility about Opex spending; hence Opex does not pose much threat to the fracking industry in the UK. However, we discover Bowland shale gas wells fail to add value at gas price of $8\/ Mmbtu. A minimum gas price of $12\/Mmbtu at Opex of no more than $2\/ Mcf and no more than $14.95M Capex are required to create value within the present petroleum tax regime, in the UK fracking industry."

This study aims to establish the association between birthweight centiles across the whole distribution and early childhood development among children born from 37 weeks of gestation.Methods and findingsThis is a population-based cohort study of 686,284 singleton infants born from 37 weeks of gestation. The cohort was generated by linking pregnancy and delivery data from the Scottish Morbidity Records (2003 to 2015) and the child developmental assessment at age 2 to 3.5 years. The main outcomes were child’s fine motor, gross motor, communication, and social developmental concerns measured with the Ages and Stages Questionnaires—3 (ASQ-3) and Ages and Stages Questionnaire: Social & Emotional—2 (ASQ:SE-2), and for asubset of children with additional specialist tools such as the Modified Checklist for Autism in Toddlers (M-CHAT) if the ASQ3\/SE indicate these are necessary. The ASQ score foreach domain was categorised as “concern” and “no concern.”We used multivariate cubic regression splines to model the associations between birthweight centiles and early childhood developmental concerns. We used multivariate Poissonregression models, with cluster robust errors, to estimate the relative risks (RRs) of developmental concerns below and above the established thresholds. We adjusted for maternal age, early pregnancy body mass index (BMI), parity, year of delivery, gestational age at delivery, smoking history, substance misuse in pregnancy, alcohol intake, ethnicity, residential area deprivation index, maternal clinical conditions in pregnancy (such as diabetes and pre-eclampsia), induction of labour, and child’s sex.Babies born from 37 weeks of gestation with birthweight below the 25th centile, compared to those between the 25th and 74th centile, were at higher risk of developmental concerns. Those born between the 10th and 24th centile had an RR of 1.07 (95% CI: 1.03 to 1.12, p < 0.001), between the 3rd and 9th centile had an RR: 1.18 (95% CI: 1.12 to 1.25, p < 0.001), and <3rd centile had an RR of 1.37 (95% CI: 1.24 to 1.50, p < 0.001). There was no substantial increase in the risk of early childhood developmental concerns for larger birthweight categories of 75th to 89th (RR: 1.01; 95% CI: 0.97 to 1.05; p = 0.56), 90th to 96th (RR: 0.99; 95% CI: 0.94 to 1.05; p = 0.86), and ≥97th centiles (RR: 1.04; 95% CI: 0.97 to 1.12; p = 0.27), referent to birthweight between 25th and 74th centile.The percentage of developmental concerns attributable to birthweight between the 10th and 24th centile was more than that of birthweight <3rd centile (p = 0.023) because this group includes more of the population. Approximately 2.50% (95% CI: 1.26 to 3.61) of social skills concerns and 3.00% (95% CI: 1.33 to 4.67) of fine motor developmental concerns were attributable to birthweight between the 10th and 24th centile compared to 0.90% (95% CI: 0.48 to 1.26) and 2.30% (95% CI: 1.73 to 2.67) respectively for birthweight <3rd centile. We acknowledge the limitation of ASQ as a screening tool, the subjective nature of developmental assessments (particularly for speech) among young children, and inability to control for early childhood illness and upbringing factors may have an impact on our findings.ConclusionsWe observed that from 37 weeks of gestation birthweight below the 25th centile was associated with child developmental concerns, with an association apparent at higher centiles above the conventional threshold defining small for gestational age (SGA, 3rd or 10th centile). Mild to moderate SGA is an unrecognised potentially important contributor to the prevalence of developmental concerns. Closer surveillance, appropriate parental counselling, and increased support during childhood may reduce the risks associated with lower birthweight centiles."

Leading causes of maternal death were eclampsia (n = 187,20·6%), postpartum haemorrhage (PPH) (n = 103,11·4%), and sepsis (n = 99,10·8%). Antepartum hypoxia (n = 1455,31·1%) and acute intrapartum events (n = 913,19·6%) were the leading causes of perinatal death. Predictors of maternal and perinatal death were similar: low maternal education, lack of antenatal care, referral from other facility, previous caesarean section, latent-phase labour admission, operative vaginal birth, non-use of a labour monitoring tool, no labour companion, and non-use of uterotonic for PPH prevention.Interpretation: This nationwide programme for routine data aggregation shows that maternal and perinatal mortality reduction strategies in Nigeria require a multisectoral approach. Several lives could be saved in the short term by addressing key predictors of death, including gaps in the coverage of internationally recommended interventions such as companionship in labour and use of labour monitoring tool.Funding: This work was funded by MSD for Mothers; and UNDP\/UNFPA\/ UNICEF\/WHO\/World Bank Special Programme of Research, Development and Research Training in Human Reproduction (HRP), a co-sponsored programme executed by the World Health Organization (WHO)."

This may be related to fewer events of abnormal Doppler flow, however the prevalence of absent or reversed end diastolic flow (AEDF or REDF) in such women is unknown. In this systematic review, we aimed to synthesise available data on the prevalence of AEDF or REDF. Methods: We searched PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, CENTRAL and Global Index Medicus with no date, setting or language restrictions. All randomized or non-randomized studies reporting AEDF or REDF prevalence based on Doppler assessment of umbilical arterial flow > 20 weeks’ gestation were eligible. Two authors assessed eligibility and extracted data on primary (AEDF and REDF) and secondary (fetal, perinatal, and neonatal mortality, caesarean section) outcomes, with results presented descriptively. Results: A total of 42 studies (18,282 women) were included. Thirty-six studies reported zero AEDF or REDF cases. However, 55 AEDF or REDF cases were identified from just six studies (prevalence 0.08% to 2.13%). Four of these studies were in unselected-risk women and five were conducted in high-income countries. There was limited evidence from low- and middle-income countries. Conclusions: Evidence from largely observational studies in higher-income countries suggests that AEDF and REDF are rare among low- and unselected-risk pregnant women. There are insufficient data from lower-income countries and further research is required."

Main outcome measures: Prevalence of SMO, mortality index (% maternal death\/SMO), case fatality rate, time until death after admission, and health service performance. Results: Of 5779 women admitted with abortive pregnancy complications, 444 (7.9%) experienced an SMO: 366 maternal near-misses and 78 maternal deaths. Intra-hospital maternal mortality ratio from complicated abortive pregnancy outcome was 85\/100 000 live births. Case fatality rate was worst for abortion-related infections (19.1%). A quarter of maternal deaths occurred on the same day of admission; however, the peak time of occurrence of death was 3–7 days of admission. Women experiencing cardiovascular, renal or coagulation organ dysfunction were less likely to survive. Higher level of maternal education and closer residence to a health facility improved chance of maternal survival. Conclusions: Abortive outcome remains a major contributor to SMO in Nigeria. Although early hospital presentation by women is critical to surviving abortive pregnancy complications, improved, appropriate, and timely management is essential to enhance maternal survival. Tweetable abstract: 78 maternal deaths and 366 near-misses occurred from abortions and ectopic pregnancies in 42 Nigerian referral hospitals in 1 year."

        "abstract": "Contraceptive use in Nigeria has remained low at less than 15% for over two decades. Although husbands’ opposition is acknowledged as one of the factors impeding women’s contraceptive use, little is known about how wives negotiate when their husbands oppose family planning. We addressed this research gap by conducting thematic analyses of qualitative data from 30 interviews of married couples. We employed thematic analysis to identify relevant themes from the transcribed data. The findings clearly demonstrate attitudes highlighting an imbalance in power relations and contraceptive decision-making within marital relationships. By initially complying with the husband’s wish as a ‘sign of honour’, and then making further attempts at convincing him about family planning use, a woman can achieve her contraceptive target, or through the involvement of a third party. Wives are less empowered to overtly use contraceptives when their husbands oppose family planning. However, there are accepted justifications for covert use. The findings underscore the need to strengthen family planning interventions to enable behavioural change among Nigerian men, promote gender and reproductive health rights, and empower women with better negotiation skills."

        "abstract": "Background: Fertility rates remain persistently high in Nigeria, with little difference across socioeconomic groups. While the desire for large family size is culturally rooted, there is little understanding of how repeated child mortality experiences influence fertility behaviour and parity transition in Nigeria.Methods: Using birth history data from the 2013 Nigeria Demographic and Health Survey (NDHS), we applied life table techniques and proportional-hazard regression model to explore the effect of child survival experience on parity transitions. We hypothesize that a woman with one or more child death experience is at elevated risk of progressing towards higher parities.Results: Our findings show that child mortality is concentrated among mothers living in deprived conditions especially in rural areas of the northern part of Nigeria and among those with little or no education and, among those belonging to Hausa\/Fulani ethnicity and Islam religion. Mothers with repeated experience of child deaths were significantly at a higher rate of progressing to higher parities than their counterparts (HR: 1.45; 95% CI: 1.31-1.61), when adjusted for relevant biological and socio-demographic characteristics.Conclusion: Recurrent experience of child deaths exacerbates the risks to higher parity transition. Interventions aimed at reducing fertility in Nigeria should target promoting child survival and family planning concurrently."

Methods: It is a 3-year retrospective analysis of all the obstetrics cases with intrapartum foetal distress. Results: There were 301 cases reviewed. The birth asphyxia incidence rate was 233\/1000 live births and the perinatal death rate was 47\/1000 live births. Suspicion of foetal distress was premised on the presence of persistent tachycardia or bradycardia during intermittent auscultation. Main resuscitative measures were left lateral repositioning of patient, fast saline infusion, intranasal oxygen administration and discontinuation of oxytocin infusion, if any. Only 124 (41.2%) of all the cases had delivery achieved within 2 h of diagnosis. Mean decision-delivery interval by caesarean section was 2.93 ± 2.05 h. Socio-demographic factors (p= 0.001) and pregnancy risk category (p = 0.002) influenced incidence of birth asphyxia. Conclusion: To reduce subsisting high perinatal morbidity and mortality in sub-Saharan Africa, it is best that at the least referral hospitals should have advanced facilities for foetal monitoring and shortened surgical intervention time."

While socioeconomic and religious barriers continue to exist, psychosocial factors such as negative contraceptive perceptions by male partners may influence both spousal FP demand and use. Therefore, this research investigates the influence of male partners’ contraceptive perceptions on spousal FP demand and use. Methods We analysed the couple dataset from the 2013 Nigeria DHS. Results One in five men held the perception that contraceptive use is women's business whereas two in five men reported that women who use family planning may become promiscuous, especially older men, those with no formal education, Muslims and residents in rural areas and northern region. Results from regression models, controlling for relevant sociodemographic characteristics, show that men's perception that contraception is women's business did not significantly influence FP demand. However, their fear that women who use family planning may become promiscuous was associated with lower odds of FP demand (AOR: 0.86; 95% CI: 0.76–0.97) and increased the odds of traditional methods use (AOR: 1.34; 95% CI: 1.01–1.79).

One hundred and nineteen of the respondents (73.9%) had had sexual intercourse. Mean age at sexual debut was 19.08±3.5 years. Of those with sexual experience, 79 (66.4%) had their sexual debut with a previous boy\/girlfriend and 33 (27.7%) had it in their current relationship. Three (2.5%) respondents had first sex with a stranger. About 90% were still having sexual intercourse within 12 months of the survey; more males had had sex than females (81.1% versus 67.8%). Around 80% of those with sexual exposure practised a form of contraception, mainly use of the male condom, but fewer than 25% were all-time contraceptive users. Coming from a single-parent family (p=0.04) or from a family of poor economic status (AOR: 7.41; 95% CI: 0.69-0.83) were found to be associated with sexual debut by the age of 19 and premarital sex, respectively, in these young people. Unprotected sexual intimacy was found to be high among young school\/college drop-outs in this region of Nigeria. This group of young people need targeted reproductive health intervention as they represent a potent route for HIV transmission in the region."

Aims: To compare the efficacy of combined Foley's catheter and vaginal misoprostol with Foley's catheter or low-dose vaginal misoprostol alone for cervical ripening. Materials and methods: Women with a singleton pregnancy admitted at term for cervical ripening and IOL based on clinical indication were randomised into three groups. Oxytocin augmentation was done in the groups as indicated. Significant tests were done using chi square, Fisher's exact and analysis of variance tests. Results: A total of 210 women were randomised into the study. Women in the combined group (Foley's catheter and vaginal misoprostol) had significantly higher postcervical ripening Bishop's score than the women in the other two groups; P = 0.001. Cervical ripening time, induction–delivery time and cervical ripening–delivery interval were significantly shorter in the combined group compared to the other two groups; P = 0.001. Also, women in the combined group required significantly lesser oxytocin augmentation than the other two groups; P = 0.001. There was no difference in Apgar scores at 1 or 5 minutes or in special baby care unit admission among the groups. There were no reported cases of uterine contractile abnormalities or rupture in this study.

        "abstract": "Background: The pursuit of formal education now causes many people in developing countries to marry later in life, thereby leading to increased premarital sex and unintended pregnancies. Efforts have been made to characterize awareness and use of emergency contraception (EC) among undergraduate students in public universities in Nigeria; however, it is not known if students in private tertiary institutions adopt different practices or if having an affluent family background plays a role. This pilot study therefore aimed to assess the awareness and use of EC among students at a private Nigerian university toward assisting education planners in developing strategies in improving students' reproductive well-being. Results: Out of 94 female students, 42 (44.7%) had sexual experience, but only 32 (34.0%) were currently sexually active. Six students (6.4%) had had unwanted pregnancies, of which all but one were terminated. Fifty-seven respondents (60.6%) were aware of EC, though only 10 (10.6%) ever practiced it. The greatest source of EC information was from health workers and peers; the lowest source was family or relatives. Most respondents desired orientation and availability of EC on campus. EC awareness among the students was predicted by upper social class background (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 2.73; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.06-7.45) and upbringing in the Federal Capital Territory (adjusted OR, 4.45; 95% CI, 1.56-14.22). Conclusions: Though awareness of EC was higher among the private university students in this study than at most public universities, there was no difference in EC usage. A high pregnancy termination rate was observed; dilatation and curettage were mainly adopted. In Nigeria, youth-friendly reproductive health information and access should not be limited to government-owned tertiary institutions but also extended to private ones."

Significantly fewer women who had Caesarean section resumed coitus within six months when compared with those who had vaginal deliveries (59.2% versus 78.4%). Perineal injury did not predict resumption of coitus or experience of dyspareunia. Conclusion In contrast to the norm, more women in southwest Nigeria are resuming coitus soon after childbirth.

Data was obtained on their socio-demographic features, haemoglobin concentration at booking, compliance with iron supplements and third trimester haemoglobin value.RESULTS: Observed iron supplementation compliance rate was 184(72.2%). There was a significant drop in mean haemoglobin (Hb) concentration between the two time points (booking Hb: 32.56±2.99; third trimester Hb: 31.67±3.01; mean diff: 0.89±3.04; t = 4.673; 95% CI= 0.52-1.27; p= <0.001). Anaemia increased from 132(51.8%) to 150(58.8%) by the third trimester. Increase in anaemia occurred in both iron-compliant and non-compliant groups. Non-compliance however had higher odds of predicting anaemia by the third trimester (OR: 1.83; 95% CI: 1.03-3.26; p: 0.04).CONCLUSION: Although iron supplementation is still a good intervention in developing countries, it is not sufficient to reduce overall prevalence of anaemia by the third trimester.

Patients and methods: This was a 3-year retrospective review of the case records of women with tubal pregnancies managed at the Ekiti State University Teaching Hospital, Ado-Ekiti, Nigeria. Clinical and sociodemographic parameters were obtained, including information on onset of symptoms and intervals between the symptoms and when help was sought and obtained at the hospital. Results: There were 92 cases of tubal pregnancies, giving an incidence of 18 per 1,000 births. Most of the patients were married (74.7%), parous (64.9%), and urban dwellers (76.9%), and 11% were severely anemic on arrival. The case-fatality rate was 1.1% and 74.7% had delay in seeking care, while 82.4% of the women spent more than 2 hours after admission before surgical intervention. Rural dwellers (adjusted odds ratio 2.96, 95% confidence interval 1.08–8.36) and those without formal education (adjusted odds ratio 6.39, 95% confidence interval 1.06–67.30) had delays in seeking help, while problems with funds (χ2=7.354, P=0.005) and initial misdiagnosis (χ2=5.824, P=0.018) predicted delay in obtaining help at the hospital. Conclusion: RTPs are common gynecological emergencies in our environment that are often associated with delayed decisions to seek help and obtain care. Efforts should be geared toward women’s education and financial independence, improved hospital accessibility, and better diagnostic skills."

Although some regulatory efforts have been deployed to tackle this problem, less attention has been placed on the possible motivation for seeking prayer house intervention which could be hinged on the spiritual belief of patients about pregnancy and childbirth. This study therefore seeks to determine the perception of booked antenatal patients on spiritual care during pregnancy and their desire for such within hospital setting.Method: A total of 397 antenatal attendees from two tertiary health institutions in southwest Nigeria were sampled. A pretested questionnaire was used to obtain information on socio-demographic features of respondents, perception of spiritual care during pregnancy and childbirth; and how they desire that their spiritual needs are addressed. Responses were subsequently collated and analyzed.Results: Most of the women, 301 (75.8%), believe there is a need for spiritual help during pregnancy and childbirth. About half (48.5%) were currently seeking for help in prayer\/mission houses while another 8.6% still intended to. Overwhelmingly, 281 (70.8%) felt it was needful for health professionals to consider their spiritual needs. Most respondents, 257 (64.7%), desired that their clergy is allowed to pray with them while in labour and sees such collaboration as incentive that will improve hospital patronage. There was association between high family income and desire for collaboration of healthcare providers with one's clergy (OR 1.82; CI 1.03-3.21; p = 0.04).Conclusion: Our women desire spiritual care during pregnancy and childbirth.

Reasons for this include the hot tropical climate and febrile illnesses that mask hot flushes, large bone mass of black women offering inherent protection against osteoporosis-induced fractures, and an extended family system contributing to women's psychological adjustment to menopause [1]. However, there is growing concern that these assumptions may not be true and that a significant proportion of menopausal women may be tolerating reproductive health burden in silence"

Method A total of 216 eligible pregnant women were randomised into antenatal and postnatal counselling groups. The 'Antenatal group' received one-to-one antenatal contraceptive counselling on several occasions while the 'Postnatal group' received a single one-to-one contraceptive counselling session at the sixth week postnatal check, as is routinely practised. All participants were contacted six months postpartum by telephone or personal visit, and questioned about their contraceptive use, if any. Results More women who had multiple antenatal contraceptive counselling sessions used modern contraceptive methods than those who had a single postnatal counselling session (57% vs. 35%; p = 0.002). There was also a significantly more frequent use of contraception among previously undecided patients in the Antenatal group (p = 0.014). Conclusion Multiple antenatal contraceptive counselling sessions improve the use of modern postpartum contraception."

        "abstract": "Objective: To determine whether rectally administered misoprostol can induce intestinal motility compared with oxytocin infusion when used to prevent primary postpartum hemorrhage after cesarean delivery. Methods: In a prospective randomized double-blind study in Nigeria, 218 parturients undergoing cesarean delivery who had risk factors for primary postpartum hemorrhage were enrolled between July 1, 2010, and March 31, 2011. Participants received 600 μg of rectal misoprostol or 20 intravenous units of oxytocin for 4 hours after surgery. The primary outcome was time until passage of flatus. Adverse effects, need for additional analgesic, and length of hospital stay were also assessed. Results: The misoprostol group had a significantly shorter mean postoperative interval to passage of flatus (20.27 ± 7.77 hours versus 38.34 ± 10.98 hours; P < 0.001) and commencement of regular diet (21.08 ± 7.69 hours versus 39.13 ± 10.94 hours; P < 0.001). Gastrointestinal adverse effects were more frequent, albeit not significantly, in the misoprostol group: nausea, 6.4% versus 1.8%; vomiting, 7.3% versus 2.8%; and abdominal distension, 3.7% versus 2.8%. The need for additional analgesic was the same in the 2 groups. Conclusion: After cesarean delivery, rectal misoprostol had the added benefit of inducing intestinal motility. Misoprostol might be considered in a clinical setting where postoperative ileus is anticipated."

        "abstract": "Universities have traditionally supported the distribution of critical and cultural theory through departmental and centre publishing (e.g. Working Papers in Cultural Studies) and the establishment of university presses. However, over recent decades publishing has been increasingly outsourced to commercial providers, buttressed by volunteer academic labour extracted for profit by the publishing industry. At the same time, faced with ongoing casualisation and ever-increasing workloads, the labour required for academic publishing is severely undervalued by the university and in a permanent state of crisis. In this article we put forward a radical proposal for universities to provide scholars dedicated time to support publishing as part of their academic service work. We intervene strongly into discourses that approach the publishing labour crisis by arguing for calculative solutions in the form of payment or credit. Instead, this article explores reorienting the labour underpinning academic publishing within the university itself by positioning it as an integral part of scholarly research and what it means to be a researcher. We make this argument through an in-depth engagement with debates on academic citizenship on the value of service work and discourses on academic labour derived from within critical university studies. We further support our argument by drawing on discussions on labour and open access (OA) publishing, referencing various alternative models currently being developed that, based on scholar-led, library-led and ‘new’ university press publishing, are experimenting with innovative ways to value and perform labour relations as part of community-controlled collective organisations. As universities are increasingly financially and infrastructurally supporting such initiatives, particularly with recourse to library budgets, we explore how this in many ways has left labour issues for publishing as a service performed as part of an academic’s workload unaltered. We therefore argue for the urgent need to reconfigure how universities view the labour behind academic publishing, to support more ethical engagements and relations with publishing, bring knowledge production back under the control of academic communities, and to support greater academic autonomy within universities."

        "abstract": "This paper reflects on the role librarians and Library and Information Science (LIS) curricula can play in promoting experimental publishing and in nurturing and facilitating interactions with openly available books. It outlines research conducted for the Community-led Open Publication Infrastructures for Monographs (COPIM) and Open Book Futures projects, which mapped the different kinds of experimental (book) publishing currently taking place—including information about the (open source) tools, resources, software, best practices and guidelines for experimental publishing presently available—in response to a professed need of publishers and academics to experiment more with the format of scholarly publications. Experiments with open, multimodal, processual, and more bibliodiverse forms of publishing question how the hegemonic scholarly communications system is currently set up. What does this imply for the role of the librarian within scholarly communications? This paper positions the support of and facilitation of experimental publishing as an extension of the traditional role of librarians to promote interactions and engagement with research (with librarians playing a key role in community building), while also lining up with growing demands from libraries and faculties for scholarly communication services, and library efforts to promote social justice, decolonisation, and excluded and indigenous knowledges. Furthermore, it reflects on the growth of libraries as publishers, and the important role library presses have played in promoting open access and innovative forms of publishing. Finally, this paper describes one of the outcomes of the COPIM project, the Experimental Publishing Compendium, and outlines how it could be used as a resource in LIS curricula."

In parts one and two of this report, we situate experimental books in the context of academic research and map current experiments in book publishing in order to create a typology accompanied by a selection of examples of experimental book publishing projects. In part three of this report we then review existing resources on tools, platforms, and software used in the production of experimental books, and we sketch a roadmap and methodology towards the creation of the online resource mentioned previously. To support the pilot cases we have made a start with exploring two key practices within experimental publishing and the creation of experimental books that feature within this online resource: collaborative writing and annotation. As such we outline tools, platforms, software, and workflows that support and enable these practices next to describing the desired aspects we argue this technical infrastructure should cover."

She presents a series of cutting-edge experiments in arts and humanities book publishing, showcasing the radical new forms that book-based scholarly work might take in the digital age. Adema's proposed alternative futures for the scholarly book go beyond such print-based assumptions as fixity, stability, the single author, originality, and copyright, reaching instead for a dynamic and emergent materiality.Adema suggests ways to unbind the book, describing experiments in scholarly book publishing with new forms of anonymous collaborative authorship, radical open access publishing, and processual, living, and remixed publications, among other practices. She doesn't cast digital as the solution and print as the problem; the problem in scholarly publishing, she argues, is not print itself, but the way print has been commodified and essentialized. Adema explores alternative, more ethical models of authorship; constructs an alternative genealogy of openness; and examines opportunities for intervention in current cultures of knowledge production. Finally, asking why it is that we cut and bind our research together at all, she examines two book publishing projects that experiment with remix and reuse and try to rethink and reperform the book-apparatus by taking responsibility for the cuts they make."

        "abstract": "This report explores how publishers and authors can promote, nurture, and facilitate interaction with openly available books. Open access (obviously) opens up scholarship, but it also offers scope to enhance interactions between books, scholars, publishers, resources, librarians, and of course readers. This might take the form of creating communities and conversations around books, of gathering comments and hyperlinks, or of enabling updating, remixing and reusing, translating, modifying, reviewing, versioning, and forking of existing books. Open access, in short can create additional value and new avenues and formats that go beyond openness, by changing how people interact with books. Research shows that making books available in open access enhances discovery and online consultation (Snijder, 2019), but the short outline above makes clear that there is still a lot to be done to stimulate, explore, and practice the full range of book interactions made possible by open access.The first part of this report provides a literature overview that identifies the opportunities that digital technologies and enhanced interactions with open access books can provide for scholarship; it outlines some of the main types of interactions around scholarship—and around and as part of open access books more in particular—that scholars are involved in; and it showcases some of the experiments within humanities book publishing with reuse and remix; finally it presents some of the main (technological and socio-cultural) inhibitions that have prevented further uptake of these practices. The second part of this report more closely explores the technical dependencies that the introduced interactions and affordances rely upon. Doing so, it outlines and showcases various open source tools, software, technologies, platforms, infrastructures, guidelines and best practices, that lend themselves to being adopted by publishers and authors (or by publishers and authors working in collaboration with each other) to facilitate interaction around their book(s). The third part of this report then summarises the findings of the previous parts and provides recommendations, guidelines, and strategies (again, both socio-cultural and technological) for publishers and authors to further open up their books and collections to community interaction and reuse.Who is this Report for?The main communities we want to reach with this report are publishers and authors\/scholars (or communities of scholars), to explore how they, by experimenting and often just making simple adjustments, can start to open up and stimulate interactions around their books. Where larger (commercial) publishers often have the resources to develop tools and workflows for interaction in-house (and often proprietary), scholar-led publishers, for example, although they have been at the vanguard of more experimental forms of publishing, have indicated that they often lack expertise and familiarity with more experimental forms of publishing and with the tools available to support them (Adema and Stone, 2017). We therefore focus in this report on open source tools and openly and freely available resources and guidelines that can help small-scale and not-for-profit book publishers that cannot afford to build their own custom platforms, to stimulate engagement around books. We also show various examples throughout this report of how publishers, publishing collectives and platforms, authors, and scholarly communities already are stimulating interaction around books in interesting ways and the tools and practices they have adopted to do so.This report focuses on interactions with books and on books within the humanities and social sciences in particular. Many of the types of interaction and interactive practices we describe within this report (such as for example open peer review and data mining), are being used and adopted more commonly within the STEM fields (where their uptake is also more widely researched). The humanities (and to a lesser extent the social sciences) in general have lower adoption rates where it concerns these types of practices and also have field specific preferences (as well as prejudices) towards many of these practices, which will be taken into account and further discussed in this report.Types of InteractionAs part of our research we have identified several types of scholarly interaction taking place around books. The first part of this report is structured around some of the more common kinds of interaction that open access books afford: annotations, open peer review, remix and reuse, social scholarship and networked books, and emergent practices (including versioning, forking, and human computer interactions). This report doesn’t aim to cover all forms of interaction around books but has chosen to focus on the kinds of interactions that publishers and scholars would be able to promote and recreate with relatively simple adaptations to their workflows, systems, practices, and licensing. Each of the above identified types of interaction around books will be discussed in the next section, including how we can stimulate them and what obstacles currently exist towards their more general implementation. Throughout the next part of this report we will also be providing examples from within humanities book publishing to illustrate the different kinds of interaction.---   ---   ---   ---   ---   ---The report has itself been published in an experimental way. Making use of the advanced versioning functionalities offered by PubPub, we will iteratively update this document over the remainder of the project, thus allowing us to incorporate user feedback and new technological developments.Hence, we would be really grateful for constructive feedback from the communities out there who are already experimenting with new forms of interaction.

        "abstract": "Within the field of open access (OA) publishing, community-led publishing projects are experimenting increasingly with new forms of collaboration and organisation. They do so by focusing on setting up horizontal alliances between independent projects within a certain sector (e.g., scholar-led presses), or vertically across sectors with other not-for-profit organisations (e.g., through collaborations with libraries, universities, and funders), in order to create multi-stakeholder ecologies within scholarly publishing. Yet at the same time, imaginaries for future modes of OA knowledge production are still controlled through demands for ‘scalability’ and ‘sustainability’, which are both seen as preconditions for scholarly communication models and practices to succeed and to be efficient. But they are also prerequi­sites to receive funding for publishing projects or infrastructure development. The scalability of open models is perceived as essential to compete in a landscape dominated by a handful of major corporate players.Drawing on our work with the Radical Open Access Collective, the ScholarLed consortium, and the Community-led Open Publishing Infrastructures for Mono­graphs (COPIM) project, this article outlines an alternative organisational prin­ciple for governing community-led publishing projects based on mutual reliance, care, and other forms of commoning. Termed ‘scaling small’, this principle eschews standard approaches to organisational growth that tend to flatten community diversity through economies of scale. Instead, it puts forward the idea that scale can be nurtured through intentional collaborations between community-driven pro­jects that promote a bibliodiverse ecosystem while providing resilience through resource sharing and other kinds of collaboration. Following Anna Tsing’s recom­mendations to keep in mind how reimagining our knowledge practices requires we pay particular attention to articulations between the scalable and the nonscalable (Tsing, 2012), what is needed to enable this is, first and foremost, a rethinking of existing systems and infrastructures and how they currently function – systems that have historically developed and been continuously remade to encourage fur­ther scalability. We further explore the possibilities of scaling small with particular reference to Anna Tsing’s work on the ‘latent commons’ and Massimo De Angelis’ discussion of ‘boundary commoning’, examining how these concepts are on display within the Radical Open Access Collective, ScholarLed and the COPIM project. As we will argue, reimagining the relations within publishing beyond a mere calcula­tive logic, i.e., one that is focused on assessing the sustainability of alternative models, is essential in not-for-profit OA publishing environments, particularly if we want new forms of collaboration to arise and to redefine the future of scholarly publishing in communal settings."

As a result, COPIM is developing a significantly enriched not-for-profit and open source ecosystem for OA (open access) book publishing that will support and sustain a diversity of publishing initiatives and models, particularly within Humanities and Social Sciences (HSS) publishing.The adoption of alternative infrastructures, business models, preservation structures, and governance procedures to be scoped and developed through COPIM will enable increased economic resilience and enhanced capacities for open access books at smaller and larger scales. COPIM's approach will offer Higher Education institutions and HSS researchers sustainable publishing models they control, increased publishing options, and new revenue streams and cost reductions to build a more equitable horizontal and co-operative knowledge sharing community. During the first year of the project, COPIM has established a solid foundation in the areas of collaborative research, infrastructure development, project management, and outreach and community building. Successfully adapting its approach to face a set of unforeseen challenges, the project has achieved the majority of its deliverables and milestones across all work packages, in some areas even outperforming the initial goals set.The list of key output and activities delivered includes:the publication of two major scoping reportsthe successful organisation and documentation of eleven workshops with more than 120 national and international high-profile stakeholders representing 18 countriesthe successful switch to an online-only approach due to COVID-19, which now includes the setup and iterative extension of an Outreach and Dissemination network that is combining a variety of channels including social media and open community platforms;and the initial setup and continuous further development of a resource to make open access book metadata available in an open, transparent and participatory way, which will integrate into the larger Open Dissemination System, to be developed in Years 2 and 3.The project has successfully fostered engagement with the work packages’ variety of stakeholders (i.e. librarians, publishers, authors, technology providers and the general public), bringing together key experts and those interested in learning more about scholar-led not-for-profit OA book publishing. Next to its own event organisation and outreach activities, COPIM has also been invited to participate in a variety of external conferences, events, and networks by organisations and projects such as Invest in Open Infrastructure, OASPA, OPERAS, LIBER, the Next Generation Libraries Project, and the Open Access Book Network, The British Library, OpenAIRE, COAR, and EIFL.The overall progress made during this first year seems particularly noteworthy as the project not only had to face the challenges of first-year setup, including early minor delays in staff recruitment, onboarding, and the organisation of basic project management and governance structures; COPIM was also faced with a set of unprecedented challenges that permeated all aspects of the delivery process and will potentially impact the remainder of the project going forward. The main challenges include Brexit and its impact on the economy—and corresponding uncertainties—and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, with all systemic consequences that this entails.Building on the foundational research, project management structures and outreach networks that have been successfully established in Year 1, the project is eager to continue on its path to further developing the envisioned infrastructures, pilot cases, governance structures, and outreach programmes it is set to deliver in Years 2 and 3."

        "abstract": "Attached to this issue of Convolution are four tear-out postcards, printed on the back flap of the cover. These have been designed to evoke the now largely forgotten medium of Reprint Request Cards. Today made obsolescent by the ease of PDFs downloaded directly from journals, databases, or perhaps torrented and accessed via so-called shadow libraries, Reprint Request Cards once constituted an important tool among communities of readers and writers and served as means of obtaining copies of publications directly from their authors. Although most prominent among scholars in the (social) sciences, due to the historical centrality of journals in scientific publication, Reprint Request Cards speak poignantly to the nature of contemporary publishing and draw attention to the changes brought about by the turn to reading online, irrespective of the disciplinary context.Reprint Requests, Leung, Robson, and Siu note, “begun as a matter of courtesy within a small group of scholars” and by the early 1920s became an established and common method of accessing and circulating publications within the scientific community.  The mechanism of obtaining a reprint was simple: having identified an article of interest, a reader mailed the author a card requesting it and, a few weeks later, received a printed copy of the publication in the post. While a reprint could have been requested via a regular letter, libraries, publishers, or indexing services, such as The Institute for Scientific Information, provided standardized Reprint Request Cards as well as indexes of authors’ addresses. This made the process of requesting publications easy and, perhaps most importantly, encouraged an active community of readers and writers to emerge. A drive for engaged readership informed the practice of sharing publications in response to Reprint Request: “I remember the delight of receiving hundreds of reprint requests,” writes Steven Willey, “for individual papers that I fought long and hard with reviewers to get published.”Motivated by a similar desire, we provide here a set of four Reprint Request Cards for readers to use themselves or pass onto family, friends and colleagues. We invite the Convolution community to post a card to us and to receive in response an essay in which we take on the form of Reprint Request to explore in more depth questions so central to any attempt at writing, reading, and publishing, i.e. questions of circulation, distribution and access and, in particular, their challenges today with respect to experimental forms of writing and publishing. We look at Reprint Request Cards as characteristic forms of expression in their own right, which draw attention to the significance of the ways in which we encounter writing. But we also set this exercise in motion as an experiment in thinking about modes of community building that an act of publishing makes possible outside of the immediate contexts of today’s online sociability, which we have grown to take for granted.We hope that turning to Reprint Request Cards will reintroduce to those who choose to post them the pleasure of the postcard – of sticking a stamp, of dropping it into a letter box – so rare today. Our cards, while reproducing the format of the traditional Reprint Requests, also disrupt it. They are designed to invite our prospective readers to introduce themselves to us by filling in the blank side of the card, playfully exploring the form of the postcard and the processes of reading and writing which these cards are to initiate. As the cards arrive, we hope both to forge new connections between our text and its readers and to get to know the unique community that Convolution brings together.---Alexander K.C.

        "abstract": "Unruly gestures presents a hybrid performative intervention by means of video, text, and still images. With this experimental essay we aspire to break down various preconceptions about reading\/writing gestures. Breaking away from a narrative that sees these gestures foremost as passive entities – as either embodiments of pure subjective intentionality, or as bodily movements shaped and controlled by media technologies (enabling specific sensory engagements with texts) – we aim to reappraise them. Indeed, in this essay we identify numerous dominant narratives that relate to gestural agency, to the media-specificity of gestures, and to their (linear) historicity, naturalness and humanism. This essay disrupts these preconceptions, and by doing so, it unfolds an alternative genealogy of ‘unruly gestures.’ These are gestures that challenge gestural conditioning through particular media technologies, cultural power structures, hegemonic discourses, and the biopolitical self. We focus on reading\/writing gestures that have disrupted gestural hegemonies and material-discursive forms of gestural control through time and across media. Informed by Tristan Tzara’s cut-up techniques, where through the gesture of cutting the Dadaists subverted established traditions of authorship, intentionality, and linearity, this essay has been cut-up into seven semi-autonomous cine-paragraphs (accessible in video and print). Each of these cine-paragraphs confronts specific gestural preconceptions while simultaneously showcasing various unruly gestures."

Common characteristics are that they are open access (OA), digital first, library-based, and they often offer a smaller set of services than a traditional publisher, blurring the line between publisher and platform. In tandem, a small but notable number of academics and researchers have set up their own publishing initiatives, often demonstrating an innovative or unique approach either in workflow, peer review, technology or business model.These new publishing initiatives have a potentially disruptive effect on the scholarly communication environment, providing new avenues for the dissemination of research outputs and acting as pathfinders for the evolution of academic publishing and the scholarly record.In this report, we have captured the current landscape of new university presses (NUPs) and academic-ledpresses (ALPs) emerging within the UK. Taking different approaches for these two types of press we have captured the take-up, reasoning and characteristics of these initiatives, as well as future plans. The report concludes with a series of recommendations to help support and foster new developments in this space, to share best practice and collaboration and to identify the tools and services that will facilitate further innovation.Jisc supports universities and researchers in the provision of new digital services and innovation. We will work with the community and stakeholders to decide how we can take forward some of the recommendations listed in this report for the benefit of our members and the research community."

        "abstract": "The Journal of Media Practice (JMP) has, over the years, through its focus on media practice as research, formed an invaluable platform for the communication and circulation of practice-based media-arts research. Through collaborations with its online digital companion, the ScreenWorks platform for peer-reviewed practice research in film and screen media, JMP has been a forerunner in championing and adopting the various multimodal forms practice-based and creative works can take within the context of an academic publication.[1] However, although media practice as a field and community embraces a plurality of media, the materiality of its scholarly forms of production and communication remain predominantly text-based. How then, should a journal of media practice extend from a speculative focus on what media practice as research could be, to an exploration of the alternative forms of communication and circulation it could enable?This special disrupted issue of the JMP has been conceptualised, edited and performed collectively by Coventry University’s Centre for Disruptive Media (CDM) and the Disruptive Media Learning Lab (DMLL). Disruption, for us, should be seen as an affirmative practice, in the sense that it allows us to experiment with new forms of critique and to rethink and performatively disrupt some of academic publishing’s core foundational concepts and practices, from the single author and the linear argument to the fixed and finalized text-object (for more on this alternative affirmative vision of disruption, see: Broekman et al. 2014; Hall 2016; J. Adema and Hall 2016). As editors, it was important to experiment with how media practice, in rethinking research as practice, could also be involved in disrupting the way we mediate this research through various formal and informal scholarly forms (including the academic journal).  As such we put forward a number of provocations with respect to what a ‘journal of media practice’ should or could be, to provide an alternative to the standard single-authored linear 8000-word journal article, that continues to dominate the field, as well as the Journal of Media Practice itself. What would experimental and interventionist forms of mediation and presentation in this respect look like for media practice? And how can JMP stimulate ongoing conversations `around these issues?  As such we wanted to explore three central questions in this special issue:How is media practice disruptive of and re-performing the way we do scholarly communication and education?How can JMP reconfigure (the politics of) its own practice?What should a disruptive ‘journal’ of media practice look \/ sound \/ feel like?"

Cary Wolfe insists “the nature of thought itself must change if it is to be posthumanist.”1 Our argument, made manifest by this special issue of the Journal of Electronic Publishing, is that it is not only our ways of thinking about the world that must change if they are to be posthumanist, or at least not simply humanist; our ways of being and doing in the world must change too. In particular, we view the challenge to humanism and the human brought about by the emergence of artificial intelligence, augmented reality, robotics, bioscience, pre-emptive, cognitive, and contextual computing, as providing us with an opportunity to reinvent, radically, the ways in which we work, act, and think as theorists. In this respect, if “posthumanism names a historical moment in which the decentering of the human by its imbrication in technical, medical, informatics, and economic networks is increasingly impossible to ignore,”2 then it generates an opportunity to raise the kind of questions for the humanities we really should have raised long before now, but haven’t because our humanist ideas, not just of historical change and progression (i.e. from human to posthuman, to what comes after the human),3 but of the rational, liberal, human subject, and the associated concepts of the author, the journal, and copyright that we have inherited with it, continue to have so much power and authority."

Remix can be seen as being “supported by the practice of cut\/copy and paste.” Yet, on a larger scale, cutting can also be understood as an essential aspect of the way reality is structured and defined. The first part of this chapter will provide an analysis of the way the cut and the practice of cutting have been theorized in remix studies, mostly from within a representationalist framework. This analysis will then be juxtaposed and entangled with a diffractive reading of a selection of critical theory, feminist new materialist and media studies texts. These specifically focus on the act of cutting from a performative perspective, from which I will explore what a posthumanist vision of remix and the cut might look like. In the second part of this essay, I will examine how the potential of the cut and related to that, how the politics inherent in the act of cutting, can affirmitively be applied to scholarly book publishing. How can we account for our own ethical entanglements as scholars in the becoming of the book? After analyzing how the book functions as an apparatus, a material-discursive formation or assemblage which enacts cuts, I will explore two publishing projects—Living Books about Life and remixthebook—that have tried to re-think and re-perform the apparatus. Both projects specifically take responsibility for the cuts they make in an effort to “cut well.” How have these projects established an alternative politics and ethics of the cut that is open to change, and what are their potential shortcomings?"

Humanities and Social Sciences have suffered from the serials crises, as library funds for the purchase of monographs came under pressure.The Open Access model addresses the monograph crisis in two ways. By making a digital edition freely available through the Internet the access to and discoverability of the monograph are greatly improved. The Open Access model also provides the opportunity to find a new sustainable business model for monographs, based on the reduced production costs of the digital edition and building on emerging business models for Open Access journals. Open Access models for monographs differ from the models for Open Access journals, because the Open Access version of a monograph does not substitute printed books in the same way that e-journals are substituting printed journals. But although the business models may differ, there are no obstacles to achieve Open Access for books.There are clear benefits to the academic community and society at large and both publishers and funders are experimenting with a variety of models to enable Open Access to monographs."

        "abstract": "This article explores how a cultural studies perspective can be used to criticallyanalyse practices of conducting research within the (Digital) Humanities. It usesamongst others the example of the author’s PhD dissertation currently in process,which is set up as a theoretical and practical intervention into existing discoursessurrounding the dominant form of formal communication within the Humanities: thescholarly monograph. A methodology of critical praxis is seen as an integral part ofthe research project as well as an important step in developing academic or researchliteracy through actively engaging in the production of communicative norms andpractices. Envisioning the book as a site of struggle over new forms and systems ofcommunication within academia, the dissertation argues for alternative ways ofthinking of and performing the monograph in an experimental manner. By making useof digital platforms, tools and media to share, remix and update the research as itevolves, the aim is to develop a digital, open and collaborative research practice. Thiswill offer a practical critique of the dominant structures, politics and practices ofproducing and distributing research results. This article thus argues for theempowering potential of critically analysing and actively engaging with the dominantnorms underlying communication in the Humanities as well as with the structures thatdetermine academic literacy and the established and accepted practices herein. Byarguing for a potential new future for the book within scholarly communication as anemergent and evolving form, based on accessibility, sharing, process and change, thisarticle makes a case for new ways of engaging a critical praxis that is morespeculatory, open-ended and experimental."

        "abstract": "On Smoke: Remembrance & Reclamation is an interdisciplinary, practice research project comprising photographic portraits and a film installation. Commissioned by PROFORMA Arts on behalf of Manchester City Council for European Capital of Culture: Chemnitz 2025, it marks 40 years of the twin-city partnership between Manchester, UK, and Chemnitz, Germany.Manchester and Chemnitz have been twin cities since 1983 and are both recognized for their textile-based industrial heritage. Today, with populations of 618,800 and 243,000 respectively, they maintain a cultural exchange program featuring artist exchanges, civic collaborations, exhibitions, conferences and public events.Research Questions:1.         In what ways do residents of Manchester and Chemnitz perceive and reflect on their shared histories as twin cities and former industrial hubs undergoing post-industrial transformation?2.         In what ways do literary and cinematic tropes of the past, such as smoke, symbolize and convey the shared histories of Manchester and Chemnitz as twin cities navigating post-industrial transformation?3.         In what ways can performative art methods innovate photographic practices in order to bring to life and visualize the shared histories of Manchester and Chemnitz as twin cities?This research project aims to explore the shared and intertwined histories of Manchester and Chemnitz by examining the collective memories of the cities’ residents. Research methods integrate interviews, roundtable discussions, and workshops with performance and lens-based practices that employ smoke as a symbolic device to visualize the past.In the photographic portraits and a film installation smoke serves as a metaphor for the shared industrial legacies of both cities, shaped by their manufacturing heritage, where it was a defining byproduct of production. Simultaneously, smoke functions as a visual metaphor for the impermanence and transient nature of memory. By intertwining the shared industrial histories of the cities with the ephemeral materiality of smoke, this research project demonstrates how the identities of these cities are shaped not only by tangible, documented events but also by the subjective and fleeting experiences of their communities.Situated within the expanded field of chronopolitical art, this research project adopts an interdisciplinary theoretical framework. It combines critical theory, temporal aesthetics, and memory politics with performance and lens-based practices as employed in cinema, and the visual arts."

        "abstract": "This thesis, On Smoke and Fog: Performance Revisioning, Remembrance and Reclamation, critically evaluates two research residencies (September 2017 to August 2019) and a series of performance works titled Notes for a Performance. The practice-led research looks to establish performance art practice as a vital means of engaging with heritage sites and archives.  Considering how performance art practice can extend and embody heritage sites and archives by applying an anachronic methodological approach to historical material. The hypothesis being that to reveal the archive one must recognise the layers, loops, folds, and cracks of history. That to understand historical collections and heritage sites, artists must acknowledge the impossibility of truly defining fixed historiographic narratives. That any reading of history can only be understood in the present and embodied ‘now’ as defined by François Hartog as Presentism and Hayden White and Frank Ankersmits narrativisit philosophy of history, and that performance art is the ideal way to articulate this.The performance works re-imagined the overlooked and uncatalogued in the sites and archives, presenting a ficto-factual reading of the past that montages the historically known and the unknown alongside cultural references, collective memory, and meta narrative structures. Working with un-catalogued and partially catalogued collections the performance series embody the historical variables in these disordered and fractured archives. The performances mined the multi-directional presence of the historical sites supporting a contemporaneous fictioning (as defined by David Burrows and Simon O’Sullivan) that collates past, present, and future.The performative qualities of smoke, fog and mist are applied in the performance works to create an obfuscated and temporally disjunctive embodiment of the historical material within a contemporary art space. These miasmas are discussed in the thesis in the context of collective memory, cinema, and transmission of affect (as defined by Teresa Brenan). The Notes for a Performance series, accompanying publications and thesis contribute new knowledge in the fields of chronopolitics and performance art practice, situating the research in relation to these contemporary art forms and creative meta-narrative writing."

The houses offer huge benefits in terms of energy saving, comfort and host a multitude of sustainable technologies within. The houses use an increased amount of timber in the structure and there is a question on whether this increased use of timber combined with the current UK timber shortage could potentially mitigate the sustainability of the house. The research assesses the problem from both the worker and consumer viewpoints using collected primary data and analyzes the feedback well as this alternate solution Passive Houses are explored and compared and the market for these kinds of technologies is researched to conclude whether these houses could potentially become a widespread product across the UK. This research concludes that making passive houses more widespread is possible, but it would rely on a countrywide push to make it happen. Standards need to be raised and an increased level of continuing professional development in this specialised field would need to be put in place to allow for sustainable innovations to become more common."

In theUK, 400million tonnes of materials are used for construction purposes. Of these 400million tonnes of materials, 100millions tonnes of wasteis produced and 25million tonnes are deposited in landfills, contributing to about 45% of CO2 emissions which then causes the environmentto be harmful. Therefore, it is necessary to uncover the barriers affecting the effectiveness of construction waste management in the UK construction industry which is the aim of this research. To achieve this, this research will adopt the use of the mixed method to research to gatherfindings. Quantitatively, the use of a well-structured questionnaire was adopted and qualitatively, an interview survey was adopted. Both wereadministered to construction professionals in the west-midlands region of the UK construction industry with above 5 years of experience withknowledge of waste management. From the findings, it was evident that construction contractors in the UK are not rightly supplied with theright information about waste management, but this information is readily available. Therefore, it is necessary for the main body of constructionindustry professionals to sensitise contractors about how important waste management is as it assists in improving a company’s turnover andpreserving the environment. On the micro level, a proper and proactive approach to planning should be adopted by construction contractors aspoor planning may lead to poor and incompetent managers which leads to poor workmanship and in turn increases waste generated and lastlypoor output of the construction work which then reduces a company’s profit margin."

Baghdad is Iraq capital which is an example sufferingfrom housing deficit with 451,080 units in 2009 and the number is claimed to be double in 2021. The study aimed to find a sufficient solution for Baghdad housing crises and to take Al-Sadr City: as a case study in Baghdad to implement feasible housing solutions by adopting a modern method of Construction. Al-Sadr City, the most populated district in Baghdad with 2 million people suffers from severe housing crises due to the high occupancy rate per unit, slums and urban issues; high density reached 1527 person per hectare; bout 13 person per unit as residential occupancy rate a double more than the normal rate as only 6 person per unit. The traditional method is unable to solve such City housing crises; hence, The London Model that adopted (OSM)offsite manufacturing housing took as a model due to the similarities to Baghdad housing crises and situation as well as its advantages in term of Cost-efficiency, Speed of construction, health and safety and the environmentalperformance. The study aims to propose solutions for Al-Sadr City housing issues based on London Model in term of planning, designing and application and examine the feasibility of London model to be implemented ashousing solutions for Al-Sadr City. A comprehensive methodological approached of mixed-methodological (quantitative and qualitative) approach comprise a multiple method such as: interviews, case study and questionnaire were conducted including two consecutive stages to propose a practical plan to implement the offsite manufactured homes in Al-Sadr City including planning (site location, urban planning, housing preferences) and construction; implementation50 participants (Al-Sadr City residents) took part in the questionnaire while 7 interviews were held with architecture and construction professionals. The key findings of the stage one, the study propose for the site locations of the new housing projects that linked the housing shortage and slums to be outside the City based on the data collected, additionally, the slums’ location should demolished and transferring to the green areas. Key findings of the second stage, London model is highly feasible in term of the ofimplementation due to their advantages as compared to traditional method, However, barriers such as lack of skilled workers, public awareness, high temperature should be overcomed by training, government support,enhance public awareness and focus on thermal insulation, hence practical plan could be implemented.KEYWORDS: Housing Model, Future, High-Density Cities, planning, designing, London, Baghdad."

There exists a limited use of six sigma within the UK construction industry and there are many reasons for this. Primarily there seems to be a misconception about the capabilities of six sigma in construction-specific context. Verylittle research has been done for six-sigma as a process improvement initiative for construction.Therefore, in this dissertation, the capability of six sigma to be used as a process improvement management strategy within the UK construction industry is explored in order to better propagate this method and increase its use within the industry. The current stance of six sigma within construction context is explored, drawing out the benefits and challenges of using its principles, further explaining why the UK’s construction industry lacks its application. After a detailed literature review, two case studies are presented of UK construction projects and companies which used six sigma to enhance process performance. The case studies were critically analysed to draw out the benefits and the challenges experienced in order to finally provide recommendations which will encourage the industry, whether in research or in practice to further make use of six sigma as a process performance enhancer"

However, despite the widely reported benefits of such methods, their uptake within the industry has been limited. This paper reports the findings made from a research that sought to investigate the effectiveness of MMC in terms of cost and time. A questionnaire survey was applied whereby five of the top construction companies in the country and 30 academicians it the field of construction were interviewed. The results obtained indicate that the current utilisation of MMC in the large and medium-sized housing companies is insufficient, but the level is expected to increase due to the growing pressure to improve on cost, time, quality, productivity, wastages, and health and safety of the workers. However, the perceived higher capital cost compared to the traditional method has been a major hindrance to the adoption of MMC. Despite this, as for a revolution in the construction industry of using modern construction methods, off-site MMC is not every company choice of construction form due to its higher capital and initial costs. This paper recommends a set of strategies that can be used to address the uncertainties surrounding the effectiveness of MMC and improve its usage among the construction companies"

Interviews were carried out with construction professionals in Lebanon to understand the definition, benefits, barriers, and current sustainable performance to further examine the implementation of BIM. The framework is divided into seven components that will unlock the possibility of implementing BIM in the Lebanese construction industry to achieve sustainable growth."

        "abstract": "Timber has recently gained global popularity as a material for taller building typologies. It is a material much less intensive in resource and energy use and accounts for far less greenhouse gas emissions over its life cycle in comparison to steel and concrete; the two most dominating materials in the Canadian construction industry. Mass-timber is an engineered product, which requires the use of prefabrication and CNC machining. Although this process creates much safer working environments and significantly improves the quality of the delivered products, theoretically allowing mass-timber buildings to go even higher, it requires a high level of collaboration and automation at the beginning stages of the project. It requires strong building information modelling (BIM) which is also a relatively new technological process in the industry. Several tall mass-timber projects have recently been constructed however; there has been limited documentation of the strategies and processes needed for a successful project,"

Many sources, such as, websites, videos, books, show that modular housing is extremely efficient regarding time and cost. However, this construction type is not more popular than onsite building. The purpose of this project is to find the reason, why is not modular construction taking over traditional building style and what are the barriers of implementing prefabricated houses in UK housing sector. The primary and secondary data analysed in the project shows that building modularly has many great advantages, for example, lower costs, faster construction, modern design and significant sustainability. Moreover, the project analyses main barriers when implementing modular in the housing sector of United Kingdom, which are high costs of land, low land availability, transportation costs, quality relation to time and cost. The project indicates research on barriers and implications that lay behind modular construction in the United Kingdom housing sector."

Huge numbers of houses were annually built-in construction industry, In England and Wales more than 160,000 houses are built in 2017 therefore, Promoting the improvement through airtight and insulated in building envelope can lead to high energy consumption reduction. Reducing greenhouse gas emissions is considered a significant part that related to the energy consumption requirements in terms of the operational energyof houses in United Kingdom. Reducing the energy demands can beachieved through using building materials and operational energy.Construction methods of construction can also provide impacts on the energy demands of building in terms of the materials that used during construction. Five methods of construction were selected to examine their performance in terms of the thermal resistance and factors that could affect acceptability in construction industry. The methodology was identified the behaviour of thermal performance for each method of construction through using cases study methods of previous cavity walls manufacturer. The acceptability of construction methods was carried out by collecting data of community. The main objective was to find out the optimal system of construction methods that could minimise the operational energy whilst providing comfortable houses energy"

        "abstract": "AbstractThe UK as a welfare state spends about 30% of the gross domestic product on social expenditures. The acute and biting shortage of housing, particularly social and affordable housing is responsible for the spiralling house prices and rents leading to an affordability crisis. Evidence-based research shows that the UK needs to build over 300,000 houses a year to meet the rising demand, particularly from young adults and families with low-to-middle incomes. As a result, there has been a worrying increase in overcrowding, homelessness, evictions and rent arrears. This research study aimed to investigate prefabrication, also known as modular construction as a solution to tackling the housing crisis in the UK. A mixed method approach was used to collect raw data. As such, five major construction firms were selected as the case study organisations for the research study. The respondents had a senior position in the organisations. The data collection methods that were adopted are qualitative (interviews) and quantitative (questionnaires). The data were analysed using thematic analysis in which emergent themes were identified throughout the interviews and the questionnaires. Findings suggested that the housing crisis is not about houses; instead, it is about individuals. Perceptions about prefabricated houses among the low, middle and high-income earners are largely negative whose implication is that individuals would rather wait to build traditional homes in the future than opt for a prefabricated home. Although traditional home ownership is slipping out of reach for the majority, the demand for prefabricated homes is still low. In urban areas, modular construction is practised on a small scale with the main market limitations being the small size of the domestic market and the existing building regulations which prohibit the use of inflammable materials in urban areas. Moreover, it was found that prefabricated homes may provide short-term and long-term solutions to the housing crisis since they address and resolve some of the most critical issues associated with traditional housing but not limited to high costs, longer construction periods and uncertain budgets."

There are many complications regarding this issue and some of them being is to save time and money andbuild good quality units. Year in and year out the UK can’t seem to achieve their target to fulfil the large demand. The British method of building homes is the traditional method which is brick, block and cavity, which can be expensive and a lengthy process.This research is on MMC (Modern Method of Construction) and how these modern methods can solve this ongoing problem. These modern methods can be Volumetric, Panelized, Hybrid and Site based system, these methods can beused as individuals or as a team. The author has used the factual documentation to prove that modern method of construction can have a great input in solving this problem.The methodology which the author has used is the mixed method where he obtained the valuable data from secondary research, primary research, interviews, survey questionnaires and case studies. The author started with thesecondary source where he reviewed journals, articles, books, reports and case studies and one he gained enough knowledge he moved on to obtain primary data which he found the most important and valuable data by interviewing professional from Housing Development (Senior Project Manager and CEO of the company). On the other hand, he also handed out a minimum of 50 survey questionnaires to the professional of housing construction industry containing participants from senior to a junior level including labourers as well, where mixed views were received mostly in the favour of the modern method of construction as some participants were not aware or heard of MMC. The authors also included a comparison of construction methods, such as comparing British traditional method to Modular and Breeam.Lastly, the authors came to a conclusion upon all the facts and statistics he obtained from throughout his research, he also added the recommendations and the scope of further studies, as this study would prove to provide great benefits to the future researcher in the field study of Modern Method of Construction."

There is a previous study mentioned about half of the investors or developers said there is a significant extra cost in BREEAM certified building, but BRE said otherwise. Undoubtedly, the capital cost is one of main considerations for investor and developer to construct a building. Yet, business industry sector consumes about 49% of energy consumption in the UK. Achieving higher financial return then become one the solution to encourage BREEAM certification on the commercial building. Higher financial return often associated with the health of cash flow into the company. In a commercial building, occupancy rate is vital for a company to predict their cash flow. Nevertheless, occupancy rate is also influenced by the rent and sale’s fee. Even with low occupancy rates, the building owners still have to pay the building operating cost and property taxes. However, there is little or no study about BREEAM certification’s impact on occupancy rates in UK’s commercial buildings. The main aim of this research is to increase the BREEAM certified buildings, especially the excellent and outstanding rating, by demonstrating whether BREEAM certification has impacts on Occupancy Rates in the UK’s Commercial Buildings. Research method employed in this study is a mixed research method. The result of the analysis from the questionnaire will be complement by interview analysis from experts who are from BREEAM related field. The findings showed that BREEAM certification has positive impacts on occupancy rates in the UK’s commercial buildings."

        "abstract": "The United Kingdom is currently facing a housing shortage and has been for many years, caused mostly by natural growth in population, immigration and an aging housing stock. The solution to combat this problem is not as simple as constructing many hundreds of thousands of homes across the country, with many setbacks caused by economic, environmental and social concerns. The design and planning of individual residential projects, with fundamentally sustainable schemes could help to mitigate the concerns that are causing setbacks to house building. Building Research Establishment Environmental Assessment Methodology (BREEAM) is the world’s longest established method of assessing,rating and certifying the sustainability of buildings produced by Building Research Establishment (BRE). ImplementingBREEAM on construction projects can vastly increase their sustainability compared to those that simply follow regulations.Projects that follow BREEAM specifications covered any additional costs by lower running costs during the building’s life. Providing people in the UK with homes which are built in a highly sustainable manner may allow huge benefits that outweigh the costs for both of the residents and the wider population. The general knowledge and consciences of people is also increasing for a more sustainable world, and as construction can contribute but also take away greatly from the sustainability of society, this approach to building seems obvious and yet is nowhere near mainstream as one may expect. This study looks to investigate the reasons behind a low proportion of BREEAM implementation on residential projects, when at first glance the benefits seem to greatly outweigh the costs. Secondary data gathered through a desk study was used to help determine the costs and benefits of residential projects that have implemented BREEAM. The researcher also attempted to gather primary data in the form of interviews and a questionnaire, gaining an insight into a current construction industry view on the usage ofBREEAM."

Similarly, there is lack of research about the role of normative institutions in CPA outcomes. Using data from over 23,000 firms in 43 African countries and integrating resource dependency and institutional theories, we examine the relationship between managerial regulatory engagement (MRE) - a type of CPA - and access to bank finance, and how this relationship is moderated by country-level religiosity and religion policy regime. The findings show that while the positive impact of MRE on access to bank finance is weakened in countries with high religiosity and more formal religion support, it is weaker in countries with more formal religion restriction. These findings shed light on how firms’ use of CPA to manage resource dependency is affected by the influence of institutional religiosity on the agency of politicians. We offer important theoretical contributions to the literature and generate useful implications for managers and policymakers."

In this paper, we draw on institutional and corporate governance insights to examine the relationship between CPA and bribery, which is arguably the greatest institutional failure in developing countries. Using pooled data from over 25,000 firms in 41 African countries, we find that lobbying and firm-level bribery are positively related. This relationship is weakened by in-country internet penetration and foreign ownership of firms. Taken together, the results suggest that business-government relations in weak institutional environments help to perpetuate corruption. They also suggest that internet penetration and foreign ownership help to illuminate the dark side of CPA. Leveraging this understanding, we make important contributions to the literature and highlight pertinent practical implications."

Our findings show that firms deploy four context-fitting but ethically suspect political strategies: affective, financial, pseudo-attribution and kinship strategies. We leverage this understanding to contribute to CPA in emerging countries by arguing that corporate political strategies are shaped by the reciprocity and duality of dependency relationships between firms and politicians, and also by advancing that these strategies reflect institutional weaknesses and unique industry-level opportunities. Importantly, we shed light on the muttered dark side of CPA. We develop a CPA framework and discuss the research, practical and policy implications of our findings."

Our finding further shows that using cash to finance government backed acquisitions yields extra wealth for investors on the announcement date whilst the market experience higher abnormal returns when stocks are used to finance the acquisition of privately held targets.

        "abstract": "During the last decades, environmental concerns and limited resources have set focus of research on lightweight, mechanically high-performing structures for the transportation industry, in order to reduce fuel consumptions and CO2emissions. Friction Stir Joining (FSJ), as a variant of the Friction Stir Welding (FSW), is an innovative friction-based joining technique for metal-composite hybrid structures. Joining in the plasticized state below the melting temperature of the metal leads to a comparatively small heat-affected zone, so that only minor metallurgical changes occur. Additionally, only a short processing time and no additional weight in form of fasteners is needed. The main objective of this study is to evaluate the feasibility of metal-composite structures via FSJ, intending to enable a macro-mechanical interlocking bonding mechanism. Main focus was given to the integration of an aluminium nub inserted in a carbon fiber-reinforced polyphenylene sulfide (CF-PPS) sheet, to ensure sufficient plasticization of the aluminium part and no degradation in the polymer part. Residual stress arising from the friction stir joining process was also characterised using the Contour method. In this study, aluminium alloy 6082-T6 and CF-PPS composite sheets were used to produce long lap joints. Results have shown that the joints were created at almost constant peak temperature slightly above the melting temperature of the PPS but no physical-chemical changes were detected in the PPS. In addition, the influence of a PPS film as interlayer between the sheets was investigated in order to explore a method for preventing galvanic corrosion. Preliminary results indicate that it is not possible to integrate a metal nub to the CF-PPS without interrupting the PPS film. However, it is possible to create a nub within the PPS film."

The impact of build directions on residual stress is also determined.Methods: The contour method is employed to measure the full-field residual stress component on the cross-section of samples. A complementary residual stress measurement method, incremental hole drilling, was employed for obtaining in-plane residual stress components.Results: The results show that the residual stress distribution is sensitive to the build direction, with a higher magnitude of residual stress in the direction of build than that in the transverse direction. Multiple measurements with the same manufacturing parameters show good repeatability.Conclusion: Residual stresses in the as-built parts are significant and hence a further consideration regarding relieving residual stresses is required when post-thermal treatments are developed."

The contour method (CM) was used for the verification of the phased array ultrasonic results. This allowed for a comparison of measurement methods to understand the effects on the distribution of residual stress (RS) within Ti-6Al-4V samples and the effectiveness of measurement of residual stress using phased array ultrasonics. From the results of the experiments, the phased array ultrasonic data were found to be in good agreement with the CM results and displayed similar residual stress distributions in the samples. The results of the individual elements of the phased array were also compared and an improvement in accuracy was found. From per-element results, anomalies were found and could be mitigated with the ability to average the results by using phased array ultrasonics. Therefore, based on these results, there is a strong case for the benefits of using phased array ultrasonics as a method of residual stress measurement for WAAM Ti-6Al-4V components over other existing residual stress measurement techniques."

This paper explores residual stress in WAAM Ti‐6Al‐4V walls built using three different deposition strategies: single bead, parallel path, and oscillation path. The effect of interlayer hammer peening and interlayer temperature was investigated for the single bead walls. We also examined the residual stress in compact‐tension (C(T)) coupons extracted from large builds (walls) with crack orientation either parallel with or perpendicular to the build direction. This type of sample is often used for the measurement of the fatigue crack growth rate. The contour method was used for experimental determinations of residual stress. In addtion, residual stress in the C(T) coupons was estimated by finite element (FE) analysis. A good agreement was achieved between the contour method and FE analysis. The oscillation‐path wall had the lowest residual stress values. For the single bead walls built with various process conditions, residual stress was significantly reduced after removing the substrate. A interlayer temperature of 110 °C resulted in much higher residual stress values in the wall (both tensile and compressive) compared to the continuous build. with much higher interlayer temperature."

Concerns for metallic parts built via SLM are the process-induced residual stresses, and anisotropic mechanical properties. This paper investigates the effect of residual stresses on the fatigue crack growth rate of SLM Ti6Al4V in as-built and stress-relieved conditions. Neutron diffraction and the contour method are employed to measure residual stresses in compact-tension samples. Neutron diffraction results are in good agreement with the contour method. It was found that tensile stresses are present at the notch root and the free edge areas, and compressive stress is seen in the middle of the sample. The tensile stresses in the as-built condition resulted in a higher fatigue crack growth rate. After stress relieving by heat treatment, the tensile residual stress diminished by around 90%, resulting in decreased crack growth rate. The build direction was seen to affect the crack growth rate, although the trend was different between the as-built and stress-relieved conditions."

Residual stresses build up in the substrate and deposited materials resulting from the CS process can influence the integrity of a coating or repair. However, the nature, magnitude and distribution of residual stresses in Ti-64\/Ti-64 CS repairs are currently unknown. This study aims to evaluate the effects of geometrical variables (i.e. the number of CS layers, CS layer thickness, and substrate thickness) and track pattern on the magnitude and distribution of residual stresses in CS deposit-substrate assemblies. Through-thickness stress distributions were measured experimentally by neutron diffraction and contour method. Furthermore, a comparison among different residual stress build-up mechanisms induced by CS processes has been discussed for different combinations of substrate and deposit assemblies. An analytical model based on the force and moment equilibrium requirements was used to interpret the experimental stress profiles and to predict the residual stress distribution. It was found that residual stresses are highly tensile near the free surface of the Ti-64 deposits as well as towards the bottom of the substrate, and compressive near the interface region. Although all the specimens showed similar stress distribution, the magnitudes were found to be higher in one or more of the following cases: specimens with a higher number of CS layers, lower substrate thickness, higher layer thickness (i.e. at lower scanning speed), and deposited with a horizontal track pattern."

Increasing the rubbing velocity was found to numerically increase the peak of residual stress while narrowing the distribution. Only small changes arose from increasing the applied pressure or changing the oscillation direction.

The stresses in Ti-6Al-4V wire + arc additively manufactured (WAAM) intersections are lower compared to single pass walls and stresses in continuous walls are larger compared to discontinuous walls with otherwise identical geometry. Thermal stress relief was found to virtually eliminate them. Inter-pass rolling can yield the desired grain refinement, without having any noteworthy influence on the development of residual stresses. The strain measurement itself by neutron diffraction is facilitated by the refined microstructure, because the otherwise textured microstructure produces anisotropic peak intensity, not allowing Pawley refinement. Without rolling, the f1011g and f1013g family of hcp planes are the only ones that diffract consistently in the three principal directions."

In this study, residual stresses have been characterized in laser and shot-peened marine butt welds with a particular focus at the fatigue crack initiation location at the weld toe. X-ray diffraction, synchrotron X-ray diffraction, incremental center-hole drilling, and the contour method were used for determination of residual stress. Results showed that the use of ablative tape increased the surface compressive stress, and the depth of compressive stress increased with an increase in number of peening layers. A key result is that variation of residual stress profile across laser peen spots was seen, and the residual stress magnitude varies between the center and edges of the spots.Published Statement: The final publication is available at Springer via http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1007\/s11661-016-3867-y"

A typical cutting artifact and its impact on measured stress values have been identified and demonstrated for a contour cut in a welded marine steel. A procedure is presented to correct contour displacement data from the influence of WEDM cutting artifacts, and is demonstrated on the correction of a measured weld residual stress.

Due to its high directivity, it has a potential security advantage over traditional radio frequency (RF) communications. However, eavesdropping attacks are still possible in long non-terrestrial transmission FSO links, where the geometry of the link allows foreign flying objects such as Unmanned Aerial vehicles (UAVs) and drones to interrupt the links. This exposes non-terrestrial FSO links to adversary security attacks. Hence, data security techniques implementation is required to achieve immune FSO communication links. Unlike the commonly proposed physical layer security techniques, this paper presents a lab-based demonstration of a secured FSO communication link based on data cryptography using the GNU Radio platform and software-defined radio (SDR) hardware. The utilized encryption algorithm (Xsalsa20) in this paper requires high-time complexity to be broken by power-limited flying objects that interrupt the FSO beam. The results show that implementing cryptographic encryption techniques into FSO systems provided resilience against eavesdropping attacks and preserved data security. The experiment results show that, at a distance of 250 mm and laser output power of 10 mW, the system achieves a packet delivery rate of 92% and transmission rate of 10 Mbit\/s. This is because the SDR used in this experiment requires a minimum received electrical amplitude of 27.5 mV to process the received signal. Long distance and higher data rates can be achieved using less sensitive SDR hardware."

Three models (Lambertian, Gaussian, and empirical) are utilized to examine the impact of vehicles headlights radiation pattern on the statistical path loss of VVLC system. The analytical model of channel path loss is validated by Monte Carlo simulation with the headlight model simulated with a raytracing software. The path loss values of the Gaussian model differ by 2 dB compared to the Lambertian model, irrespective of the traffic conditions while it differs by 24.6 dB during late night and 8.15 dB during rush hours compared to the empirical model of a Toyota Altis headlight.

On the basis of the characteristic function (CHF) of GG random variables, we derived an approximated bit-error rate (BER) for the CAP modulation scheme with spatial diversity and equal-gain combining (EGC). Furthermore, we simulated the performance of the CAP system with diversity and LDPC for various turbulence conditions and validated the analysis.

However, there is a limited number of studies on three dimensional (3D) VLP and the effect of multipath propagation on the accuracy of the 3D VLP. This study proposes a supervised artificial neural network to provide accurate 3D VLP whilst considering multipath propagation using receiver diversity.

Underwater path loss was calculated by a generalized Lambertian formula, and the fading induced by weak turbulence was modelled as a lognormal -distribution random variable. Based on the channel model and Monte Carlo (MC) simulation, the bit error ratio (BER) performance for quadrature - amplitude modulation (QAM) asymmetrically clipped optical OFDM (ACO -OFDM) and DC -biased optical OFDM (DCO -OFDM) systems in the channel with and without turbulence was evaluated.

We propose to extend the application of minimax filtering from state estimation in the radio frequency (RF) domain to intruder tracking using VLC. The performance of the proposed method was examined and compared with Kalman filter for both VLC and RF. The simulation results showed that the minimax filter provided marginally better tracking and was more robust to the adversary behavior of the intruder than Kalman filter, with less than 0.5 cm estimation error.

Even in clear atmospheric conditions, the FSO link experiences severe fading due to the turbulence effect. Turbulence is induced by random variations in refractive index due to temperature and pressure fluctuations along the FSO beam propagation. Turbulence can introduce deep fading (20 to 30 dB); as a result, the outage probability increases significantly. In order to mitigate the channel fading, the receiver or transmitter diversities or a combined transmitter and receiver diversity (known as multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) techniques) are often considered along with other techniques such as modulation, temporal and wavelength diversities. In this chapter, the FSO link performance in the presence of the turbulence fading using transmitter and receiver diversity is discussed."

This approach offers flexibility to describe vehicles locations, speed and direction as well as stationary and non-stationary reflectors which are changing rapidly and continuously.

In this paper,  an investigation on scattering regimes for underwater links using Monte Carlo simulation has been presented.While the focus of this paper is on diffuse links, the simulation results of collimated links is also provided for comparison purpose. Three types of water namely clear, coastal and turbid water are being used in the simulation. It is shown that the effect of scattering on the path loss cannot be accurately modeled by the existing channel model; ie. Beers-Lambert (BL) law.  It has been shown that  the distance at which the unscattered light drops to zero can be used to estimate the transition point for the scattering regimes in case of diffuse links. The transition point for diffuse links in coastal water and turbid water can be estimated to be around 22 m and 4 m respectively. Further analysis on the scattering order probability at different scattering regimes illustrates how scattering is affected by beam size, water turbidity and distance. From the frequency response plot, it is estimated that the bandwidth of several order of GHz can be achieved when the links are operating in the minimal scattering region and will reduce to several hundreds of MHz when the link is operating in multiple scattering region."

Carbon capture and storage (CCS), an important strategy to reduce global CO2 emissions, is one of the critical objectives of this UK net-zero plan. Among the possible storage site options, saline aquifers are one of the most promising candidates for long-term CO2 sequestrations. Despite its promising potential, few studies have been conducted on the CO2 storage process in the Bunter Closure 36 model located off the eastern shore of the UK. Located amid a number of oil fields, Bunter is one of the primary candidates for CO2 storage in the UK, with plans to store more than 280 Mt of CO2 from injections starting in 2027. As saline aquifers are usually sparsely drilled with minimal dynamic data, any model is subject to a level of uncertainty. This is the first study on the impact of the model and fluid uncertainties on the CO2 storage process in Bunter. This study attempted to fully accommodate the uncertainty space on Bunter by performing twenty thousand forward simulations using a vertical equilibrium-based simulator. The joint impact of five uncertain parameters using data-driven models was analysed. The results of this work will improve our understanding of the carbon storage process in the Bunter model before the injection phase is initiated. Due to the complexity of the model, it is not recommended to make a general statement about the influence of a single variable on CO2 plume migration in the Bunter model. The reservoir temperature was shown to have the most impact on the plume dynamics (overall importance of 41%), followed by pressure (21%), permeability (17%), elevation (13%), and porosity (8%), respectively. The results also showed that a lower temperature and higher pressure in the Bunter reservoir condition would result in a higher density and, consequently, a higher structural capacity."

        "abstract": "Structural trapping is known to be the primary storage mechanism in geological carbon sequestration (GCS), where the injected CO2rises upwards due to buoyancy forces and becomes trapped under an ultra-low permeability layer. Although it is relatively common in GCS studies to assume a planar caprock for the synthesised models, in a real scenario this is not always the case as the caprock might exhibit some small- or large-scale topography changes. Moreover, little is known about the impact of the caprock morphology on the CO2plume migration and the storage capacity. In this work, we performed a preliminary study of the effects of boundary conditions on the CO2plume migration and dissolution. This was performed because most of the case study models which are employed for GCS studies are part of larger reservoirs. The obtained results were used in the simulation models of the second part of the work, to model an infinite-acting reservoir appropriately. Three different volume modifier values of 105, 107and 109were considered on either one side or both sides of the reservoir for both horizontal and tilted caprock models. The CO2dissolution in the tilted models was seen to be higher once the multiplier was on the opposite side of the slope. Horizontal models closed on one side (closed faults, salt walls, etc.) were also found to exhibit more significant dissolution than models which were open from both sides. We subsequently investigated the impact of caprock morphology on the CO2plume advancement and its structural and dissolution trapping mechanisms by performing numerical simulations on nine synthetic models. The dissolution and migration distance are seen to be at a maximum for tilted reservoirs, where the CO2has more space to migrate upwards and to interact with more formation water. The lowest dissolution occurred where the significant portion of the injected CO2was trapped in a sand ridge or an anticline. Moreover, the possibility and also the amount of structural trapping was evaluated using an analytical method, and the results showed a fair match with the ones from the numerical simulation. We believe that this methodology could be applied for site screening prior to performing numerical simulations."

        "abstract": "Geological carbon storage is a promising solution to reduce the CO2concentration in the atmosphere to ameliorate the effects of global warming from the greenhouse effect. Among feasible storage options, deep saline aquifers are believed to have the largest storage capacity for the gas collected from industrial processes. The first CO2storage project at a commercial scale in a saline aquifer is in the Sleipner field of the Utsira storage formation in Norway. The long ongoing storage operation in the Sleipner field has been the subject of several past studies attempting to recreate the observed injected CO2plume migration behaviour. History matching is a method to adjust the input parameters of the model in a way to minimise the mismatch between the simulated and the actual production data in reservoir engineering and applicable to carbon sequestration. Typical parameters adjusted in history matching are porosity, absolute and relative permeability data. In this study, we used an adjoint-based optimisation tool and showed the importance of caprock morphology in finding an accurate plume match. Using a set of synthetic models, we initially minimised the mismatch between the observed and simulated CO2plume outline by modifying the caprock topographical details. After testing the optimisation tool on the synthetic models, we applied the methodology to the Sleipner benchmark 2019 model and improved the plume match by locally adjusting caprock elevation within seismic detection limits. We subsequently improved the match by calibrating porosity, permeability, CO2density and injection rate together in an experiment in which we calibrated all the parameters, including the caprock morphology, to find a better match. The results showed an improvement of around 8% (compared with the original model) in the plume match resulting from an average absolute elevation change of 3.23 m in the model while keeping the other parameters constant. Calibrating the porosity, permeability, CO2density and injection rate resulted in a 5% improvement in the match, and once caprock morphology was included in the optimisation process, the match improvement increased by 16%. We changed the caprock elevation within a range lower than the seismic detection limit, and results showed that even a few metres variations in the elevation have significant impacts on the plume migration and trapping mechanism in the Sleipner model. The method presented in this work results in a better match than the original seismic data for the Sleipner model."

The Containment and Monitoring Institute Field Research Station contributes to scientific and technological progress that ensures the secure underground storage of CO2. In this study, the process of shallow CO2 gas injection (300 m) and subsequent plume development at the FRS was investigated using numerical simulation. Due to reservoir uncertainties, various sensitivity analyses were performed to illustrate their effects on CO2 saturation, plume distribution and CO2 dissolution in a saline reservoir in response to variations in horizontal permeability (kh), kv\/kh ratio and CO2 injection rate. The distance of horizontal migration of the plume post-injection was predicted analytically, and the result was validated against the numerical simulation prediction. Results show that increases in kv\/kh ratio resulted in increases in both vertical and lateral plume migration and in decreases in dissolution rate and CO2 solubility. It was also indicated that the subsequent post-injection CO2 migration rate was independent of both kv\/kh and previous injection rate. Dissolution varied significantly with changes in horizontal permeability. The model shows that increased horizontal permeability facilitated plume migration vertically and horizontally. Modeled permeability variations in horizontal permeability (kh) and kv\/kh ratio had a progressively decreasing effect on plume vertical migration with time, while lateral migration effects increased with time."

Various sources of uncertainty in the geological model and the fluid have been investigated. Most of the work undertaken on the Sleipner model employed the one factor at a time (OFAT) method and analysed the impact of uncertain parameters on plume match individually. In this study, we have investigated the impact of some of the most cited sources of uncertainties including porosity, permeability, caprock elevation, reservoir temperature, reservoir pressure and injection rate on CO2plume migration and structural tapping in the Sleipner. We tried to fully span the uncertainty space on Sleipner 2019 Benchmark (Layer 9) using a vertical-equilibrium based simulator. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that a study has focused on the joint effect of six uncertain parameters using data-driven models. This work would raise our scientific understanding of the complexity of the impact of the reservoir uncertainty on CO2plume migration in a real field model. The caprock elevation was shown to be the most important parameter in controlling the plume migration (overall importance of 26 %) followed by injection rate (24 %), temperature (22 %), heterogeneity in permeability (13 %), pressure (9 %) and porosity (6 %)."

In this study, we have questioned the widespread use of the simplified geological model and have shown the impact of the structure of the sealing unit on the long-term CO2 migration direction and trapping mechanisms through a systematic approach. To achieve this goal, a comprehensive sensitivity analysis is performed using 375 different scenarios to study the impact of well-location, small scale topography variations of caprock (rugosity) and aquifer slope on CO2 migration and trapping mechanisms. The results show an increase in the amount of dissolved and trapped CO2 by increasing the tilt angles."

        "abstract": "To improve the reservoir simulation model, uncertain parameters such as porosity and permeability in the reservoir rock strata need to be adjusted to match the simulated production data with the actual production data. This process is known as History Matching (HM). In geological CO2 storage that is being promoted for use in depleted hydrocarbon reservoirs and saline aquifers, CO2 tends to migrate upwards and accumulate as a separate plume in the zone immediately beneath the reservoir caprock. Thus caprock morphology is of considerable importance with respect to storage safety and migration prediction for the purpose of long-term CO2 storage. Moreover, small scale caprock irregularities, which are not captured by seismic surveys, could be one of the sources of errors while matching the observed CO2 plume migration and the numerical modelling results (e.g. Sleipner). Thus here we study the impact of uncertainties in slope and rugosity (small scale caprock irregularities not captured by seismic surveys) on plume migration, using a history-matching process. We defined 10 cases with different initial guesses to reproduce the caprock properties representing an observed plume shape. The results showed a reasonable match between the horizontal plume shape in calibrated and observed models with an average error of 2.95 percentages"

        "abstract": "Saline aquifers constitute the most abundant geological storage option for Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) projects. When injected in the aquifer, due to its lower density in comparison to the in-situ brine, the free phase CO2 tends to migrate upwards. This vertical migration is generally tens of metres depending on the reservoir thickness, despite the plume migration distance in the horizontal direction which could be over hundreds of kilometres (depending on the time horizon, reservoir characteristics, trapping mechanisms involved, etc.). In many situations, the plume ends up as a separate region below a sealing barrier. This large aspect ratio between the plume migration in the horizontal and vertical directions would potentially validate the use of vertical equilibrium (VE) models in CO2 storage studies. In other words, when phase segregation occurs rapidly compared to the time scale studied, vertical equilibrium can be assumed, allowing for the use of specially adapted models. In the VE model, the equilibrium between brine and CO2 is pre-assumed at all times. Under this assumption, the injected CO2 plume flow in 3D can be approximated in terms of its thickness in order to obtain a 2D simulation model, which consequently decreases the computational costs. The time by which phase segregation occurs depends on the aquifer thickness, aquifer permeability, fluid properties, etc. However, the CO2 and in-situ brine are separated considerably fast and form two separate layers, in comparison to the time period for lateral migration.The CO2lab module of the Matlab Reservoir Simulation Toolbox (MRST) used in this work, is a set of open source simulation and workflow tools to study the long-term, large-scale storage of CO2. We employed the VE tool in MRST−CO2lab (MVE) to study the effect of caprock morphology on the CO2 migration. The results have been compared with a number of simulators including ECLIPSE-black-oil (E100), ECLIPSE-compositional (E300) and ECLIPSE-VE (EVE) models and the differences between the approaches are analysed and discussed in detail. In particular, we focused on the impact of caprock morphology and aquifer top-surface slope on the CO2 structural and dissolution trapping mechanisms and plume migration. The results indicated a good agreement for the ultimate plume shapes in all the models. However, the amount of dissolved CO2 in the brine was different."

        "abstract": "In the application of two-phase flow in porous media within the context of CO2 sequestration, a non-wetting phase is used to displace a wetting phase residing in-situ to the maximum extent through a network of pore conduits. The storage performance of this physical process can be assessed through numerical simulations where transport properties are usually described using the Brooks & Corey (BC) or van Genuchten (vG) model. The empirical constant, namely the pore geometry index, is a primary parameter in both of these models and experimental evidence shows a variation in the value of this empirical constant. It is, therefore, essential to cast this empirical constant into a ternary diagram for all types of clastic porous media to demarcate the efficiency of two-phase flow processes in terms of the pore geometry index (PGI). In doing so, this approach can be used as a tool for designing more efficient processes, as well as for the normative characterisation of two-phase flow, taking into consideration the predominance of capillary pressure or relative permeability effects. This concept is based on the existence of a PGI estimation for clastic sediments, for which the value for 12 sediment mixtures fall between 1.01 and 3.00. Statistical data obtained from soil physics is used for developing and validating numerical models where a good match is observed in numerical simulations. In this context, a new methodology for the effective characterisation of PGI for different clastic rocks is proposed. This paper presents theoretical observations and continuum-scale numerical simulation results of a PGI characterisation for the prediction of the hydraulic properties of clastic reservoir rocks. The effect of key parameters in the vG empirical model, such as the pressure strength coefficient and the PGI, is incorporated into the simulation analysis. In particular, the model is used to investigate the effects of parameter representation on CO2 storage performance in a saline aquifer. Subsequent analysis shows that the PGI is a very important parameter for defining the flow characteristics of simulation models. It can also be flexibly changed for each rock type and this approach may thus be practical when simulating the evolution of CO2 plume in reservoirs with sedimentary heterogeneities, such as intra-aquifer aquitard layers or graded beds. The use of the realistic PGI boundaries promises a more precise description of the hydraulic behaviour in sandstones and shale when using either the BC or vG model."

        "abstract": "History matching is the process of modifying a numerical model (representing a reservoir) in the light of observed production data. In the oil and gas industry, production data are employed during a history matching exercise in order to reduce the uncertainty in associated reservoir models. However, production data, normally measured using commercial flowmeters that may or may not be accurate depending on factors such as maintenance schedules, or estimated using mathematical equations, inevitably has inherent errors. In other words, the data which are used to reduce the uncertainty of the model may have considerable uncertainty in itself. This problem is exacerbated for gas condensate and wet gas reservoirs as there are even greater errors associated with measuring small fractions of liquid. The influence of this uncertainty in the production data on history matching has not been addressed in the literature so far. In this paper, the effect of systematic and random flow measurement errors on history matching is investigated. Initially, 14 production data sets with different ranges of systematic and random errors, from 0 to 10%, have been employed in a history matching exercise for an oil reservoir and the results have later been evaluated based on a reference model. Subsequently, 23 data sets with errors ranging from 0 to 20% have been employed in the same process for a wet gas reservoir. The results show that for both cases systematic errors considerably affect history matching, while the effect of random errors on the considered scenarios is seen to be insignificant. Although reservoir model parameters in the wet gas reservoir were not as sensitive to the flow measurement errors as in the oil reservoir, for both cases, the future production forecast was significantly affected by the errors. Permeability was seen to be the most sensitive history matching parameter to the flow measurement errors in the oil reservoir, while for the wet gas reservoir, the most sensitive parameter was the forecast of future oil and gas production. Finally, considering the noticeable effect of systematic errors on both cases, it is suggested that flowmeter calibration and regular maintenance is prioritised, although the subsequent economic cost needs to be considered."

The economic efficiency of energy producing systems is currently greater than in the past, but there are still many people around the world who live with energy poverty. Data analysis can be a powerful means to increase energy production efficiency further, as a consequence reduce the cost. In this study, hydrocarbon production data from the oil and gas industry has statistically been analysed in order to reduce the total cost of operations and increase the economic recovery of wells. The study has focused on mitigating the uncertainty in well production data caused by discontinuous flow measurement of hydrocarbon production streams of individual wells. Our results show that for oil wells with large flow rate fluctuations, undertaking just one flow test per month can create unacceptable uncertainties in estimating the production of the well. The analysis suggests that increasing the number of flow tests per month from one to four can significantly decrease the estimation uncertainty and eventually increase the economic recovery of oil and gas for an individual field."

        "abstract": "One of the possible options to mitigate the climate change is sequestering anthropogenic carbon in the deep saline aquifers.  When injected in the formation, due to the difference in buoyancy forces between the gas and the brine, the free phase CO2 is driven upwards and will eventually collect as a separate, thin layer beneath the caprock. Therefore, the structural geometry of this upper seal plays a significant role in the long-term CO2 plume migration and trapping behaviour.  In practice, at the kilometre scale, there are considerable topography changes, and the caprock structure is identified by domes and anticlines. Researchers primarily use 3D numerical simulators to study the long-term behaviour of the CO2 plume. This study looks at the impact of the dipping and sinusoidal pattern between two strata on the storage process using a full 3D simulation as well as an upscaled model based on the vertical equilibrium (VE) assumption. The 3D simulation is performed using the ECLIPSE-blackoil and the MRST (MATLAB Reservoir Simulation Toolkit) is used for the VE approach. Under the VE assumption, the CO2 plume flow in 3D can be approximated in terms of its thickness to obtain a 2D simulation model, which significantly decrease the computational cost and avoids the discretization error caused by limited vertical resolution in a 3D model. Over the time period simulated, our observations of lateral migration showed that the CO2 and resident brine became quickly separated and formed two separate layers. To our knowledge, this is one of the first comparisons between the standard three-dimensional reservoir simulator and two-dimensional VE formulation for studying the impact of caprock morphology on CO2 storage."

        "abstract": "Although the interest in using multi-phase flow meters in the oil and gas industry has recently increased, there remain some oil and gas fields in which the flow rate of their individual wells is measured by occasional well tests. In such fields, the commingled production streams from all the wells are transferred to the separation unit and the total production rates are subsequently measured by single phase flow meters. As a consequence, although continuous flow measurement data of the total production is available for the whole field, the production data of the individual wells within it is intermittent. In the absence of measured data between two well tests, well flow rates are estimated by allocation factors which are calculated based on the well test data. While allocation factors are normally assumed to be constant between two consequent well tests, fluctuations in the well production typically change values over time. Long time intervals between well tests can therefore create large uncertainties in the allocation results. In this research, the effect of increasing the regularity of well tests on the uncertainty in the allocation process has been studied. Fluctuations in the production of three actual wells have been statistically analysed and quantified using their relative standard deviation. The same fluctuations have then been applied to the production streams of a simulated oil field with 36 wells to generate three different cases. Allocation and hydrocarbon accounting calculations have subsequently been undertaken for one to four well tests conducted per month. The pattern of fluctuations has been generated using a Matlab code. Each calculation has been repeated 100 times with different patterns and the results have been subsequently averaged and reported. The results show that increasing the regularity of flow tests can considerably reduce the allocation error. The most significant reductions were observed when the number of flow tests was increased from one to two per month. In this case, the average allocation error of the three investigated cases was reduced by 0.43%, 0.45%, and 1.11% which is equivalent to an $18.2M (Million), 18.9M, and $46.6M decrease, respectively, in the cost of allocation uncertainty for the three cases based on hydrocarbon accounting calculations. The results of the case studies suggest that the cost of allocation uncertainty can be reduced by $27.1M, $29M, and $80.1M, respectively, for the three cases if well tests are undertaken weekly instead of monthly."

Promising target sites to store this CO2 are depleted oil and gas reservoirs. Although it such sites seem ideal, these abandoned oil and gas wells can prove to be significant CO2 leakage points due to the quality of the cement used in the initial well bore casings and the caps at the end of their productive life.

In addition, we hypothesize and test whether the nature of relation between financial risk hedging and cost of equity capital varies and is more negative or more ambiguous with economic shocks. Our results show that engaging in financial risk hedging enables firms to have a lower cost of capital. Consistent with the extant literature, we control for potential endogeneity problems and sample selection bias using instrumental variables and treatment effects approaches. Thus, our results are robust to a battery of sensitivity checks, including the use of multiple estimation methods and alternative proxies of cost of equity measures.

Our major contribution in this paper is that we first demonstrate theoretically the conditions under which hedging can increase or decrease firm value. Our theoretic model demonstrates that the ambiguous relationship between hedging and firm value may be due to a subtle combination of economic (managerial self-interest, agency problems\/moral hazard, managerial ability, managerial risk aversion) and behavioural factors (overconfidence). Our empirical analysis confirms the ambiguous effect of hedging on firm performance. Empirically, we focus on the use of derivatives in the corporate hedging of three types of financial risk (foreign currency, interest rate and commodity price risks), and examine the effect on value and performance of listed UK corporations during 2005-2017. We demonstrate that the positive or negative effects of the hedging strategies varies significantly across both the financial risk that is hedged and the type of derivatives contracts used in the hedging as well as the time period in consideration."

        "abstract": "FES has been applied for movement restoration, rehabilitation and therapy in spinal cord injury and nervous system failure subjects, whose number rise worldwide every year. Despite the increase, assist devices that are expected to aid healthcare delivery are not in abundance and could be as a result of standards imposed due to the sensitive condition of the subjects. Although closed loop control systems are expected to positively aid in that regards, the delicacy of the plant was a big constraint. An existing model from the works Ferrarin and Pedotti was elaborated from the knee swinging to the sit-to-stand movements and from the two mathematical models it can be inferred that even though similar higher level of excitation would be required for sit-to-stand manoeuvre. As part of research to improve on closed approach for the FES system, an appraisal was successfully done on the neuromuscular model together with fatigue models from the works on Lynch. The remodelled fatigue models to suit the research were presented."

        "abstract": "FES induced movements from indication is promising due to encouraging results being obtained by scholars. The kinematic model usually constitute the initial phase towards achieving the segmental dynamics of any rigid body system. It can be used to ascertain that the model is capable of achieving the desired goal. The dynamic model builds on the kinematic model and is usually mathematically cumbersome depending on the number of degrees-of-freedom. This paper presents a kinematic model applicable for human sit-to-stand movement scenario that will be used to obtain the dynamic model the FES induced movement in a later study. The study shows that the 6 DOF conceptualized sit-to-stand movement can be achieved conveniently using 4 DOF. The 4 DOF has an additional joint compared to similar earlier works which makes more it accurate and flexible. It is more accurate in the sense that it accommodates additional joint i.e. the neck joint whose dynamics could be captured. And more flexible in the sense that if future research uncover more contributions by the segments it can be easily incorporated including that of other segments e.g. the trunk, neck and upper limbs."

FES over the years have showed improvement capability in movement restoration, gait rehabilitation and therapy. Annual rise in neurological disorder subjects without same occurring in terms of FES based support devices are worrisome. It could be that more refinement is required to pass clinical stages. Control systems used have been continuously improved in order to meet up with the challenge. The study presents the sliding mode (SM) controller for FES induced sit-to-stand (STS) movement restoration in paraplegics. It can also be applied to other forms of maneuvers and applications. The controller shows robustness in reducing perturbations related and superior tracking ability. Ease of implementation in relation to intelligent methods and presence of mathematical model making advanced analysis easier. The linearized model was used to obtain the PID gains and were utilized for the controller gains using the nonlinear. It was further used as the basis for determining the SM controller parameters. Hence, the sliding mode control (SMC) method have portrayed improved tracking and robustness ability for the FES-aided STS movement revival in paraplegics. The study is novel in the sense such contributions have never been explored for FES induced STS movement restoration application. Therefore, it is expected with further investigations that it might help towards attaining clinical acceptance."

        "abstract": "Achieving automated control of FES induced walking had been a challenge for control system engineers. This work examines control efforts in FES aided movement applications with the aim of identifying a gap in knowledge that would create an impact towards solving or getting closer to total approval for clinical usage, easy to understand and use, simple, faster implementation and with high regards to safety. Effort was made to use all available means within reach and are close to works on restoration of gait control with emphasis on the lower limbs. FES can be applied alone (pure), but for walking or other active exercise it is usually combined with orthosis (hybrid). Nature of the plant which is a combination of the nervous, muscular and skeletal (neural-muscular-skeletal) systems as well as of limitations in sensor availability made the linear approach not favorable to such systems. Intelligent strategies most likely could provide clinically acceptable solutions, but are likely to face stability issues which are serious concern in this scenario, other shortcomings include longer tuning duration, re-tuning for different subjects and involvement of high computation. Stability issues can be dealt with directly when nonlinear techniques are used and also periodic utterances can be handled with relative ease. Nonlinear control techniques share the shortcoming of high computational requirement and at times complexity problems with the intelligent schemes, but kudos to achievements in microprocessor technologies that always yields higher capability processors which could eradicate issue. Hence, exploring the nonlinear technique could provide solution which could pave way for making countless things easy. That is; more impact could be made by understanding fundamentals or revisiting fundamental studies on nonlinear control for this application."

It complements the literature by providing information on the role of higher education institutions in developing skills for the circular plastic economy. Design\/methodology\/approach: This study used a mixed method approach drawing on reflective analysis on qualitative data from 5 focus groups and 12 semi-structured interviews, and structural equation modelling of quantitative data from 151 students across 4 Nigerian Universities. Findings: The results indicate that Nigerian university students are more likely to participate in the circular plastic economy through a high prominence of soft power features such as increased awareness, inspiration, idea generation, encouragement and capacity building. Research limitations\/implications: The main limitation of this study is with the sample. A larger data set, including other tertiary institutions such as private universities, polytechnics and schools of vocational studies, would strengthen the results. Practical implications: The study underlines the importance of targeted policy interventions and pedagogic innovations to drive awareness and knowledge building among Nigeria’s youth population. Originality\/value: This study makes a novel contribution by using empirical evidence to determine the predictors of student participation in the circular plastic economy. This understanding is important for the development and implementation of appropriate policies that promote participation in the circular plastic economy. Furthermore, given the typical youthful age bracket of university students, any plans to achieve a systemic shift in the plastic value chain must involve the young generation."

It presents an analysis of institutional ambitions, change measurement, ongoing initiatives, and their sustainability. Our study employed semi-structured interviews and focus group discussions of relevant stakeholders (staff and students) from four major Nigerian universities. Findings were categorised into two main dimensions. First, certain essential elements such as the strength of networks, entrepreneurial culture, and modelling good practices were identified as independent of management, constituting the bedrock of successful university entrepreneurial ecosystems. These elements, fundamental for fostering innovation, are intrinsic components of vibrant entrepreneurial environments within academic institutions. Secondly, the study illuminates features influenced by management, stakeholder engagement, and personalized relationships. These elements, encompassing aspects like infrastructure, funding, quality control management, and state-level policies, act as catalysts for development but are not obligatory. They function as path-dependent variables, leading to varying outputs. Despite their variability, these management-driven factors are indispensable for the evolution and scaling of university entrepreneurial ecosystems, forming the backbone of innovation within higher education institutions in Nigeria"

        "abstract": "The circular economy (CE) within the automotive industry has attracted the attention of business leaders, policymakers, and scholars in recognition of the negative impacts of the linear economy of ‘take, make, dispose’. In many developing countries, the absence of manufacturers and their approved service providers means that the automotive CE largely depend on informal micro-level CE business actors. These business actors are mostly clustered in networked mechanic villages and provide micro-level CE business opportunities. However, their micro-level CE practices and business potentials has not been explored in the literature. This paper addresses this important gap by drawing on Network Theory to show how the network CE practices of these business actors contribute to waste reduction, resource conservation, and CE eco-innovation. We also show a missing connection between the CE practices of these business actors and existing network business models that can be exploited for their benefit. We discuss our contribution in the context of the nuanced characteristics of the micro-level CE practices and business potentials that emerge from the network of these business actors. Finally, we recommend that automotive industry CE policies focus on integrating the practices of these informal micro-level CE business actors with macro and meso-level approaches."

In this paper, we develop an empirical understanding of the influence of public governance system on promoting circular economy (CE) for plastic actions among individuals. Through a survey of 1475 participants across five sub-Saharan African countries, we tested five hypotheses drawing on New Governance Theory and CE Action Recipe to explore the relationship between governance and individual's actions supporting CE for plastic. We found that a governance system that supports CE practices and exhibits governance efficiency is positively associated with individuals' actions supporting CE for plastic. The awareness of government policies, laws and regulations, institutions, processes, and programmes have a significant impact on individuals' engagement in plastic circularity practices. The paper's theoretical and governance implications highlight the relevance of public governance in shaping action towards a CE for plastic at the individual level."

        "abstract": "In recognition of the need for an economic logic that complements and reinforces the ecological imperative for the circular plastic economy, this paper explores the importance and impact of digitally enabled circular plastic business models across retailing and distribution systems. The paper draws from 16 focus group discussions, complemented by 17 semi-structured interviews of frontline organisations incorporating digital innovations in their businesses to enable the management of plastic waste in Africa. The study finds that, across African countries, the transition to a circular plastic economy has been hampered by the limited uptake of circular products by consumers. In order to accelerate the transition, innovative business models are required to invigorate the ecosystem and simplify the logistics of retailing and distribution systems. The paper proposes a new conceptual framework that explicates the impact of digital innovations in the processes of value creation and value capture across a whole spectrum of circular economy reverse logistics activities: recycling, redistribution, and remanufacture. The study also highlights two important social and policy implications of digitally-enabled circular business models: Firstly, the creation of new employment opportunities through the empowerment of a new labour force for the circular plastic economy; secondly, the heightened opportunity to enact an innovative sharing economy in typically resource-constrained contexts in which otherwise idle products and resources are more efficiently used in a process of collaborative consumption."

By examining the roles of community norms, technological accessibility, and educational objectives, the research identifies critical factors that impact the adoption and utilisation of GenAI. We employ quantitative analysis to analyse 899 survey responses from students across seventeen (17) Nigerian universities to derive interesting insights. Findings reveal that the ease of use of GenAI tools and their alignment with educational goals enhance student engagement. Conversely, regular need for technical support negatively affect engagement, suggesting underlying technological issues. These insights provide actionable recommendations for educators, administrators, and policymakers, emphasising the importance of user-friendly GenAI tools, comprehensive training programs, and robust support systems. This study contributes to the understanding of technology adoption in culturally diverse educational settings and offers strategies to improve educational practices and outcomes both in Nigerian higher education and also potentially in other African (developing countries), where similar socio-cultural dynamics might influence technology integration and educational advancements."

However, evidence of their effectiveness in curbing plastic waste pollution or in redirecting the continent towards a circular plastic economy remains under-researched. We assess plastic waste policies in Africa using Chatham Database and the DITCh Plastic Survey data, combined with one national case study (Nigeria). We utilise machine learning for text analysis of policy description. We find the continent’s efforts ineffective at directing the continent towards a circular economy due to shallow regulations, exclusion of the informal recycling sector, enforcement problems and lack of awareness of policies, amongst others. We present some broad propositions on how digital and technological tools can be used to redirect the continent from linear to circular economy and how they can also aid in plastic waste policy effectiveness. This chapter is relevant to policy making in three ways. Firstly, it shows how plastic-oriented policies are not circular in nature in Africa. Secondly, it posits that under current ineffective plastic waste policies in Africa, digital technology is an instrument that can be used to achieve a plastic circular economy. Thirdly, the realisation of the first makes a call for an innovation policy agenda (strategic direction such as digital interoperability) if Africa is to scale plastic circular economy."

Using a combination of data from the European Centre for Disease Prevention, Roser et al. (2020) and Hale et al.

To take care of the fact that the number of Covid-19 cases strongly depend on its own lag values, we used two-step system GMM for the estimations. Unlike prior studies that measure lockdown in terms of a fixed intervention date, we relied on the stringency index from Hale et al. (2020) that accommodates for the gradual lockdown measures in different countries. We found that an exogenous lockdown significantly affects the number of confirmed cases after 7 days of its implementation and its lag effects are intact even after 21 days of its implementation. A one unit change in the lockdown index decreases the total number of confirmed cases by 0.19 percent. Testing has no significant effects for at least 14 days after its implementation. However, after 21 days of its implementation, its effects become significant with −0.03 to −0.05 elasticity value."

        "abstract": "Marfan syndrome (MS) is a genetic disorder often associated with the development of aortic aneurysms, leading to severe vascular complications. The progression of this condition is intricately linked to hemodynamic factors such as wall shear stress (WSS) and von Mises stress, as abnormal distributions can contribute to thrombus formation, endothelial damage, and the worsening of aneurysmal conditions. In this study, six vascular models were analyzed: four representing diseased aortas with Marfan syndrome aneurysms and two healthy aortic models for comparison. The models were sourced from Vascular Model Repository, and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations were conducted using a Newtonian fluid model and the shear stress transport (SST) k- ω turbulent transitional model to evaluate WSS and von Mises stress. Fluid-structure interaction was employed to incorporate vessel wall interaction, and pulsatile inlet velocity profiles were used to simulate physiological blood flow, capturing time-dependent hemodynamic variations. The results revealed significant differences between healthy and diseased aortic models. In healthy models, WSS was uniformly distributed, with values consistently below 40 Pa, reflecting stable vascular conditions. Conversely, the diseased models exhibited highly non-uniform WSS distributions, with notably lower values in aneurysmal regions, contributing to thrombus formation, with elevated WSS in areas like the carotid and subclavian arteries due to geometric and hemodynamic complexities. The von Mises stress analysis identified regions of heightened rupture risk, particularly on the superior side of case MS1, where both von Mises stress and WSS reached their highest values among all cases. Physics-informed neural networks demonstrated strong agreement with CFD results while significantly reducing computational cost, highlighting their potential for real-time clinical applications. These findings underscore the critical role of hemodynamic factors in aneurysm progression and rupture risk, offering valuable insights for optimizing diagnostic and therapeutic strategies in vascular diseases."

A mathematical model is used to solve problem statements drawn from assumptions. Optimizing the allocation of resources can be achieved by using algorithms to optimise the cost of distributing resources in order to control a pandemic. The goal of this research would be to find the most cost-effective algorithm, utilizing all operational research methodologies.

We describe enrollment and retention efforts and highlight facilitators and barriers to enrollment and operational challenges, as well as accommodations made in the study protocol. Methods: The DCA study is enrolling participants in 7 centers in West Africa. Participants who consented were invited to complete dietary recalls and 24-hour urine collections in year 1. We conducted focus groups and semistructured interviews among study personnel to identify facilitators and barriers to enrollment as well as retention and operational challenges in the execution of the study protocol. We analyzed emerging themes using content analyses. Results: A total of 712 participants were enrolled in 18 months with 1256 24-hour urine and 1260 dietary recalls. Barriers to enrollment were the following: (i) a lack of understanding of research, (ii) the burden of research visits, and (iii) incorporating cultural and traditional nuances when designing research protocols. Factors facilitating enrollment were the following: (i) designing convenient research visits, (ii) building rapport and increased communication between the research team and participants, and (iii) cultural sensitivity – adapting research protocols for the populations involved. Offering home visits, providing free dietary counseling, reducing the volume of study blood collection, and reducing the frequency of visits were some changes made in the study protocol that increased participant satisfaction. Conclusion: Adopting a participant-centered approach with accommodations in the protocol for cultural adaptability and incorporating participant feedback is vital for carrying out research in low-income and middle-income regions."

        "abstract": "Objective: Static exercises are an integral aspect of patient rehabilitation and are employed in advanced strength and endurance training programmes. Exercise is a form of self-induced stress leading to circulatory and respiratory changes, therefore, this study sought to determine the influence of age and gender on the cardiovascular responses of apparently healthy individuals to isometric\/static exercises.Methodology: Sixty apparently healthy individuals (30 males and 30 females) participated in this study. Their ages ranged between 21–50 years and were grouped into 21–30 years, 31–40 years and 41–50 years. Each participant carried out and maintained 30% of maximal isometric voluntary contraction (MIVC) using hand grip for 1, 2 and 3 minutes respectively, with 30-minutes rest period. Systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and heart rate (HR) were measured and recorded, at rest, and during each of the sustained contractions.Results: There was a statistically significant increase (p <0.05) in the mean SBP, DBP and HR at rest and with every increase in duration (that is, from 1 minute to 3 minutes) of static handgrip contraction, maintained at 30% MIVC in the 3 groups; except for HR for group one (that is, 21–30 years). There was no gender difference (p >0.05) in SBP and DBP of the participants within the 3 groups, although male participants, particularly in group 2 had higher SBP. There was also a statistically significant increase in the HR of female participants compared to the males in group 2. Isometric contraction for 3 minutes produced the greatest change (increase) in cardiovascular parameter across all the groups but more marked among participants in group 2 (that is, 31–40 years).Conclusion: The study concluded that submaximal (30% MIVC) isometric upper limb exercise increase blood pressure and heart rate in both sexes, with greatest values when the exercise was sustained for 3 minutes. Hence, efforts should be made to monitor cardiovascular parameters prior to prescribing safe level of isometric exercise. Also, 3 minutes of static\/isometric exercises may be avoided, particularly during the rehabilitation of patient with cardiovascular disease."

Methods: This was a cross sectional study, which involved 400 volunteers (171 males; 229 females) aged between 18–40years. Participants’ HGS was assessed using a CAMRY EH-101 hand dynamometer while VO2max was estimated using a standard formula that includes measurement of resting heart rate. Demographic data was summarized using percentages, mean and standard deviation. Physical activity level of the participants was assessed using long form of the International Physical Activity Questionnaire. Independent t-test was used to compare the mean values of the variables between male and female participants. Pearson’s correlation was used to determine the strength of relationship between estimated VO2max and HGS, while multiple regression analysis was conducted to determine the predictors of estimated VO2max using HGS as well as body mass index (BMI), physical activity (PA) level, age and sex as co‐variates. Level of significance was set at p<0.05. Results: HGS, VO2max and PA level were significantly (p= 0.001) different between male and female participants. There was a significant moderate correlation between HGS and VO2max (r= 0.40, p= 0.001). The results of the regression analysis showed that HGS is not significant predictor of estimated VO2max; whereas, sex, BMI and PA level were significant predictors of estimated VO2max. Conclusion: Although HGS is moderately correlated with estimated VO2max, HGS may not be a relevant tool for predicting estimated VO2max in healthy young adults."

We developed a three-day module for investigators, clinical research coordinators and dieticians for dietary recall training in sub-Saharan Africa. There were thirty-five attendees to this online course administered via Zoom. Four facilitators conducted training in various aspects of the research protocol including conducting a 24h dietary recall and break-out practice sessions and interviews, for the dietary recall. To assess the efficacy of the training, participants performed a pre and post-test prior to and after the training sessions. The pre-test consisted of 35 multiple choice and open-ended questions. Twenty one participants completed the pre-test and 18 participants completed the post-test. For example, we inquired if 24h recall can be performed during the holidays and the correct responses went from 66.7% on the pre-test to 94.4% on the post-test (p<0.0001). We also calculated the mean score on a question that assessed the qualities of an interviewer performing a 24h recall and the score improved from 96.0%(SD=3.6) on the pre-test to 98.1%(SD=8.8) on the post-test, (p<0.001). Figure 1 shows responses on two questions on using the hand to measure specific food types and how many spoons a finger-tip equates to. We demonstrated that an on-line training module may be a feasible option for clinical research training in low-resource countries."

They were recruited from two tertiary health facilities in Lagos state Ethical approval was obtained from the Health Research and Ethics Committee of College of Medicine, University of Lagos, Idi-Araba, Lagos with Approval number- CMUL\/HREC\/04\/19\/519. Subjects were distributed into three groups with the aid of random numbers generated by the computer: Group A received Neck stabilization exercises only, Group B received Neck stabilization and isometric neck exercises, Group C received Isometric neck exercises only. Subjects were assessed for pain-related disability, sleep disturbance, psychological status (anxiety and depression), systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP, DBP), heart rate (HR), respiratory rate (RR), mean arterial pressure (MAP), rate pressure product (RPP), forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1), peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) and perceived exertion rate (RPE) before intervention and end of 4th week. This study was done within a period of May–October 2019.Results: This study showed that neck stabilization combined with isometric exercise improved pain-related disability (p= 0.04), anxiety (p= 0.04) and depression (p= 0.04) after 4 weeks of intervention. Some pulmonary parameters, FVC (p= 0.05,p= 0.02), FEV1 (p= 0.02,p= 0.01) improved significantly post-intervention in both neck stabilization exercise alone and neck stabilization combined with isometric neck exercise groups. While PEFR (p= 0.02,p= 0.01) improved significantly in both neck stabilization combined with isometric neck exercises and isometric neck exercise group alone post-intervention.Conclusion(s): This study draws the conclusion that neck stabilization exercise only and neck stabilization combined with isometric exercise will better improve pain-related disability, anxiety, depression, sleep disturbance and some selected pulmonary parameters (FVC, FEV1, PEFR) in patients with non-specific chronic neck pain.Impact: The physiotherapist should consider the use of neck stabilization combined with isometric neck exercise, neck stabilization exercise alone in the management of patients with non-specific chronic neck pain. The physiotherapist should also consider the assessment of patients with NSCNP for cardiopulmonary compromise to know the specific intervention that will be suitable for their management. The researcher advocates that future studies should involve a larger sample size with a longer follow-up period."

The management of knee OA has been characterized by variations among physiotherapists within Lagos state, Nigeria. However, there is a need for physiotherapists as a whole to embrace evidence –based clinical practice guidelines in the management of this condition. This study was aimed at determining if the physiotherapist’s characteristics (such as age, highest educational attainment, year of induction, years of experience and setting of practice) influence the knowledge and adherence to clinical practice guidelines in knee OA management and to find out if there is a need to develop clinical practice guidelines in the management of knee OA. This was a cross-sectional descriptive survey involving 104 physiotherapists from selected health care facilities in Lagos state. They were required to complete a 33-item questionnaire which collected information on sociodemographic data, work experience, treatment activities and their knowledge and adherence to knee OA clinical practice guidelines. Only a small percentage (16.30%) of the respondents were knowledgeable about knee OA clinical practice guidelines while even a smaller percentage (14.40%) of the respondents adhere to knee OA clinical practice guidelines. Knowledge and adherence were influenced by setting of practice (p=0.001, p=0.027). Majority (93.30%) of the respondents recommended the need for knee OA clinical practice guidelines in Nigeria. A small population of the respondents is knowledgeable and adheres to knee OA clinical practice guidelines. Some of the characteristics of the physiotherapists influence the knowledge and adherence to knee OA clinical practice guidelines. However, findings show that there is a need to develop a knee OA clinical practice guideline in Nigeria in other to standardize and improve effective treatment outcome in patient care."

Despite the document benefits of the different physiotherapeutic techniques, there is still a wide gap in knowledge on the most effective technique in restoring early functional performance post-operatively.Objective: This is to compare the efficacy of spirometry and chest-physiotherapy approaches in restoring functional performances in individuals after abdominal surgery.Methods: This study involved 90 individuals (randomized into 3 groups of 30), who had abdominal surgery in a Nigerian tertiary health institution. Group 1 received chestphysiotherapy; group 2 received incentive-spirometry and group 3 received the combination of both approaches. Functionality was assessed using 10-Meter Walk Test (10MWT) and Barthel Index (BI) while a spirometer was used to assess Forced Vital Capacity (FVC) and Force Expiratory Volume in one-second (FEV1). The BI, FEV1 and FVC were assessed at 24-hour pre-operation, and 24-hour, 3rd-day and 7th-day post-surgery while 10MWT was assessed at 24-hour pre-surgery and 7th-day post-surgery. Data was analysed with Analysis of Variance and Kruskal walis test.Results: Eighty-seven participants completed the study while 3 died. The groups were matched in all the varaibles at the pre-operation stage. There was drastic reduction in BI, FEV1 and FVC scores at immediate 24-hour post-surgery but increased rapidly throughout the 7-day period. The group who received the combined therapy performed significantly better (p<0.05) in 10MWT at 7th day postoperation. There was no significant diferent (p>0.05) in the BI, FEV1 , FVC and in the development of complications among the groups at the 3rd and 7th days post-operation.Conclusion: Abdominal surgery cause remarkable decline in functional performances. Early and monitored chest-physiotherapy and spirometry result in rapid improvement in functional performance in individuals within a week of the surgery. However, the combination of the two approaches yields better result in improving functional performance."

        "abstract": "This article explores the puzzle of victims of political violence in Kenya committing to return to contested spaces of their prior victimhood and displacement. It considers how political violence has been brought to bear on understandings of property rights and belonging among Kikuyu victims of political violence in the Burnt Forest area of Uasin Gishu County in Kenya. It is reported that the iteration between the collapse of the multiparty Kenyan state commitment to protect Kikuyu land rights in their state settled areas and the partisan character of neo-customary tenure that restricts the admission of co-ethnic outsiders, induced Kikuyu spontaneous resistance to their spatial political confinement motivating their formulation of an organic discourse of belonging. The article introduces the ‘sons of village’ concept as a bottom-up framework for understanding the informal mechanisms for claiming property rights and belonging in contested spaces in Africa. By challenging notions of belonging rooted in contested histories and emphasizing credible links to land and space, this concept embodies inclusive citizenship with the potential to foster conciliatory relations between previously hostile groups in post-conflict scenarios. The 'sons of village' identification, therefore, offers a promising avenue for fostering positive peace in regions afflicted by chronic violence in Africa and beyond."

Drawing on original survey data, Afrobarometer data, andcontent analysis of social media pages of the two mainpresidential candidates– William Ruto and Raila Odinga– and aselection of allied political in uencers’ accounts, we explore theuse of social media in Kenya’s 2022 presidential electioncampaigns. This article highlights how a complex media andelectoral landscape incentivised candidates to adopt asegmentation strategy online. Through this strategy, thedissemination of negative information was delegated to socialmedia in uencers to avoid alienating undecided voters, whilecandidate’s main pages were curated to publicise policy andcultivate a positive public image. In this regard, African politicians’innovative use of social media was shaped by both normative andcontextual political factors. We outline how social media a ordsnew avenues for electioneering that may mask old habits, and weencourage researchers to look beyond o cial campaign accountswhen assessing the impact of social media on elections."

        "abstract": "To address intensifying social and environmental challenges, development policy must learn from inclusions and exclusions of past discourses. We analyse Kenya's post-colonial agricultural policy discourse. Our analysis reveals a near-exclusive focus on the promotion of agricultural modernisation based on industrial farm inputs, a bureaucratic state and\/or ‘the liberalised market’. It was with this thrust to modernise that smallholders (and other farmers) were generally seen as aligning. Smallholders' agency to diverge from modernisation was thus marginalised in the policy discourse. Overall then, the promotion of diverse agroecological and other farmer-led directions of development was largely missing from Kenya's policy landscape."

        "abstract": "Buyer-driven governance systems and the related value chain entry and stay barriers are known to have led to smallholder farmers exiting the Kenyan fresh fruits and vegetables export value chain. This paper addresses two gaps in this literature. First, the paper addresses the question of how the fresh fruits and vegetable export smallholder farmers have managed to secure their stay in this value chain known for its high entry barriers. Second, the paper addresses the question of what happens to the smallholders known to have exited the value chain. To explore the two gaps, transaction costs theory was applied. The results show that smallholders entry and stay in the value chain was underpinned by relational contract enforcement mechanism of supply reliability. Second, smallholders were found to occasionally exit and re-enter the value chain, depending on the prevailing risks. In conclusion, the paper argues that contemporary African value chain scholarship should consider the analysis of relational contracts and their enforcement mechanism as well as the totality of smallholders’ farming, in order to understand the motives behind smallholder value chain entry and stay decisions."

        "abstract": "Previous studies of the African fresh fruit and vegetable (FFV) export value chain have shown that smallholder farmers have faced numerous regulatory challenges in complying with stringent food safety protocols, inevitably leading to their exit from the value chain. This paper considers the role of responsive regulation in ensuring that smallholders stay in this value chain. Motivational posture regulatory theory is applied to examine how actors in the Kenyan FFV export value chain are increasingly tuning their regulatory needs to each other in order to overcome the historical compliance problems. Smallholders are shown not to be passive in the regulatory process as is often thought, but to have the agency to influence the regulatory process, which if responsive to their legitimate concerns, increases their chances of staying in the value chain. The paper concludes by arguing for a shift towards responsive regulation in the value chain because of its broader benefits including cost reductions and ensuring that smallholders remain in the value chain."

        "abstract": "Objective: This paper aims to address the challenges in abstract screening within systematic reviews (SR) by leveraging the zero-shot capabilities of large language models (LLMs).Methods: We employ LLM to prioritize candidate studies by aligning abstracts with the selection criteria outlined in an SR protocol. Abstract screening was transformed into a novel question-answering (QA) framework, treating each selection criterion as a question addressed by LLM. The framework involves breaking down the selection criteria into multiple questions, properly prompting LLM to answer each question, scoring and re-ranking each answer, and combining the responses to make nuanced inclusion or exclusion decisions.Results and Discussion: Large-scale validation was performed on the benchmark of CLEF eHealth 2019 Task 2: Technology-Assisted Reviews in Empirical Medicine. Focusing on GPT-3.5 as a case study, the proposed QA framework consistently exhibited a clear advantage over traditional information retrieval approaches and bespoke BERT-family models that were fine-tuned for prioritizing candidate studies (ie, from the BERT to PubMedBERT) across 31 datasets of 4 categories of SRs, underscoring their high potential in facilitating abstract screening. The experiments also showcased the viability of using selection criteria as a query for reference prioritization. The experiments also showcased the viability of the framework using different LLMs.Conclusion: Investigation justified the indispensable value of leveraging selection criteria to improve the performance of automated abstract screening. LLMs demonstrated proficiency in prioritizing candidate studies for abstract screening using the proposed QA framework. Significant performance improvements were obtained by re-ranking answers using the semantic alignment between abstracts and selection criteria. This further highlighted the pertinence of utilizing selection criteria to enhance abstract screening."
